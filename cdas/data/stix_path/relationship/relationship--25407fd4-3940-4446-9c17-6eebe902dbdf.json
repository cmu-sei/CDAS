They can also block end-user registration of applications by their users, to reduce risk. A Cloud Access Security Broker can also be used to ban applications.\n\nAzure offers a couple of enterprise policy settings in the Azure Management Portal that may help:\n\n\"Users -> User settings -> App registrations: Users can register applications\" can be set to \"no\" to prevent users from registering new applications. \n\"Enterprise applications -> User settings -> Enterprise applications: Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf\" can be set to \"no\" to prevent users from consenting to allow third-party multi-tenant applications",
