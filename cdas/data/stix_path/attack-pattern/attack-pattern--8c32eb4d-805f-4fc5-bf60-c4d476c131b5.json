            "description": "An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. This may be direct code execution, such as when a user opens a malicious executable delivered via [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) with the icon and apparent extension of a document file. It also may lead to other execution techniques, such as when a user clicks on a link delivered via [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192) that leads to exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl. \n\nAs an example, an adversary may weaponize Windows Shortcut Files (.lnk) to bait a user into clicking to execute the malicious payload.(Citation: Proofpoint TA505 June 2018) A malicious .lnk file may contain [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) commands. Payloads may be included into the .lnk file itself, or be downloaded from a remote server.(Citation: FireEye APT29 Nov 2018)(Citation: PWC Cloud Hopper Technical Annex April 2017) \n\nWhile User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.",
