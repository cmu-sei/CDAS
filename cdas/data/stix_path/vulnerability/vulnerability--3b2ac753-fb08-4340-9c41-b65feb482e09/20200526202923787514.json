    "description": "Crestron Electronics DM-TXRX-100-STR devices with firmware before 1.3039.00040 use a hardcoded 0xb9eed4d955a59eb3 X.509 certificate from an OpenSSL Test Certification Authority, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against HTTPS sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship."
