    "name": "CVE-2018-14767",
    "description": "In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with a double \"\"To\"\" header and an empty \"\"To\"\" tag causes a segmentation fault and crash. The reason is missing input validation in the \"\"build_res_buf_from_sip_req\"\" core function. This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code."
