    "description": "The __udf_read_inode function in fs/udf/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.3 does not restrict the amount of ICB indirection, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption) via a UDF filesystem with a crafted inode."
