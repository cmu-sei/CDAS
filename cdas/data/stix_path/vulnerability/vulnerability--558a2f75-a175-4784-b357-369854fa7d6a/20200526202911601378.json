    "description": "named in ISC BIND 9.7.0 through 9.9.6 before 9.9.6-P2 and 9.10.x before 9.10.1-P2, when DNSSEC validation and the managed-keys feature are enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit, or daemon crash) by triggering an incorrect trust-anchor management scenario in which no key is ready for use."
