    "description": "The Screen Lock implementation in Apple Mac OS X before 10.9 does not immediately accept Keychain Status menu Lock Screen commands, and instead incorrectly relies on a certain timeout setting, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading a screen that should have transitioned into the locked state."
