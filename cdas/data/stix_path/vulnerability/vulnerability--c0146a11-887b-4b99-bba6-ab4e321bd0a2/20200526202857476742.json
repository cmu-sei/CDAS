    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11, 6 through Update 38, 5.0 through Update 38, and 1.4.2_40 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect availability via vectors related to JSSE.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to CPU consumption in the SSL/TLS implementation via a large number of ClientHello packets that are not properly handled by (1) ClientHandshaker.java and (2) ServerHandshaker.java."
