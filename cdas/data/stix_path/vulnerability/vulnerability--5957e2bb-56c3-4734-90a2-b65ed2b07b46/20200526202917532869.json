    "description": "In Android before 2018-04-05 or earlier security patch level on Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile and Snapdragon Wear MSM8909W, SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 400, SD 410/12, SD 425, SD 427, SD 430, SD 435, SD 450, SD 625, SD 650/52, SD 800, SD 808, SD 810, SD 820, SD 835, SD 845, SDM630, SDM636, SDM660, and Snapdragon_High_Med_2016, processing erroneous bitstreams may result in a HW freeze. FW should detect the HW freeze based on watchdog timer, but because the watchdog timer is not enabled, an infinite loop occurs, resulting in a device freeze."
