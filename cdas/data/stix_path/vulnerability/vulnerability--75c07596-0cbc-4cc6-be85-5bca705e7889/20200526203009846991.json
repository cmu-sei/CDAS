    "description": "** DISPUTED ** A stack-based buffer overflow in the subtitle decoder in Libav 12.3 allows attackers to corrupt the stack via a crafted video file in Matroska format, because srt_to_ass in libavcodec/srtdec.c misuses snprintf. NOTE: Third parties dispute that this is a vulnerability because &#8220;no evidence of a vulnerability is provided&#8221; and only &#8220;a generic warning from a static code analysis&#8221; is provided."
