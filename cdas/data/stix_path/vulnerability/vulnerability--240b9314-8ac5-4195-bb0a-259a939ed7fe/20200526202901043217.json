    "description": "DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS 6.0.6/1a, 6.0.2/1a, 5.5.7/12b, 5.5.0/1b-p1, and possibly other versions, does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for an unspecified cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie."
