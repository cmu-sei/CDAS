    "description": "The VpxVideoDecoder::VpxDecode function in media/filters/vpx_video_decoder.cc in the vpxdecoder implementation in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not ensure that alpha-plane dimensions are identical to image dimensions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted VPx video data."
