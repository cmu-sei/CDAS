    "description": "The OBJ_obj2txt function in crypto/objects/obj_dat.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8zb, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0n, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1i, when pretty printing is used, does not ensure the presence of '\\0' characters, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process stack memory by reading output from X509_name_oneline, X509_name_print_ex, and unspecified other functions."
