    "description": "In Kubernetes v1.8.x-v1.14.x, schema info is cached by kubectl in the location specified by --cache-dir (defaulting to $HOME/.kube/http-cache), written with world-writeable permissions (rw-rw-rw-). If --cache-dir is specified and pointed at a different location accessible to other users/groups, the written files may be modified by other users/groups and disrupt the kubectl invocation."
