    "description": "The read_new_line function in wiretap/catapult_dct2000.c in the Catapult DCT2000 dissector in Wireshark 1.10.x before 1.10.9 does not properly strip '\\n' and '\\r' characters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (off-by-one buffer underflow and application crash) via a crafted packet."
