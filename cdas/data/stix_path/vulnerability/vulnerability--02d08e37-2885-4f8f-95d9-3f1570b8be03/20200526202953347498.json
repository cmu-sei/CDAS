    "description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat Reader 2018.009.20050 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30070 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30394 and earlier versions. This vulnerability is an instance of a use after free vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted PDF file that can cause a memory access violation exception in the XFA engine because of a dangling reference left as a consequence of freeing an object in the computation that manipulates internal nodes in a graph representation of a document object model used in XFA. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution."
