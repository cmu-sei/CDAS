    "description": "The Comcast firmware on Motorola MX011ANM (firmware version MX011AN_2.9p6s1_PROD_sey) and Xfinity XR11-20 Voice Remote devices allows local users to upload arbitrary firmware images to an XR11 by leveraging root access. In other words, there is no protection mechanism involving digital signatures for the firmware."
