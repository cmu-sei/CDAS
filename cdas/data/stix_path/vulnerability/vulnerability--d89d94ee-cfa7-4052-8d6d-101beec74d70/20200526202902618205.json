    "description": "The default configuration of the Resources plugin 1.0.0 before 1.2.6 for Pivotal Grails 2.0.0 before 2.3.6 does not properly restrict access to files in the WEB-INF directory, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request.  NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT due to different researchers and different vulnerability types. See CVE-2014-2857 for the META-INF variant and CVE-2014-2858 for the directory traversal."
