    "description": "The PepperFlashRendererHost::OnNavigate function in renderer/pepper/pepper_flash_renderer_host.cc in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.146 does not verify that all headers are Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) simple headers before proceeding with a PPB_Flash.Navigate operation, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended CORS restrictions via an inappropriate header."
