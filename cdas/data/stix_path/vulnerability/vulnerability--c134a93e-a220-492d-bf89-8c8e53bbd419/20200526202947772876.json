    "description": "The \"\"PayWinner\"\" function of a simplelottery smart contract implementation for The Ethereum Lottery, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value with publicly readable variable \"\"maxTickets\"\" (which is private, yet predictable and readable by the eth.getStorageAt function). Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards."
