    "description": "The paravirt_ops_setup function in arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18 uses an improper paravirt_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which makes it easier for guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit value."
