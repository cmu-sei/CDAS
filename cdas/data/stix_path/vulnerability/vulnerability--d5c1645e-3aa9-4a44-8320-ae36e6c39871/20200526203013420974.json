    "description": "On BIG-IP 14.1.0-14.1.2.3, undisclosed requests can lead to a denial of service (DoS) when sent to BIG-IP HTTP/2 virtual servers. The problem can occur when ciphers, which have been blacklisted by the HTTP/2 RFC, are used on backend servers. This is a data-plane issue. There is no control-plane exposure."
