    "description": "There is no CSRF mitigation in SLiMS 8 Akasia through 8.3.1. Also, an entire user profile (including the password) can be updated without sending the current password. This allows remote attackers to trick a user into changing to an attacker-controlled password, a complete account takeover, via the passwd1 and passwd2 fields in an admin/modules/system/app_user.php changecurrent=true operation."
