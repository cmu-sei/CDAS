    "description": "The makecontext function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.25 creates execution contexts incompatible with the unwinder on ARM EABI (32-bit) platforms, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (hang), as demonstrated by applications compiled using gccgo, related to backtrace generation."
