    "description": "An issue was discovered in Mitsubishi Electric Automation MELSEC-Q series Ethernet interface modules QJ71E71-100, all versions, QJ71E71-B5, all versions, and QJ71E71-B2, all versions. The affected Ethernet interface module is connected to a MELSEC-Q PLC, which may allow a remote attacker to connect to the PLC via Port 5002/TCP and cause a denial of service, requiring the PLC to be reset to resume operation. This is caused by an Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock."
