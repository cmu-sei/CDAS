    "description": "The SQL interface in SAP HANA before Revision 102 does not limit the number of login attempts for the SYSTEM user when the password_lock_for_system_user is not supported or is configured as \"\"False,\"\" which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication via a brute force attack, aka SAP Security Note 2216869."
