    "description": "The try_to_unmap_cluster function in mm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14.3 does not properly consider which pages must be locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by triggering a memory-usage pattern that requires removal of page-table mappings."
