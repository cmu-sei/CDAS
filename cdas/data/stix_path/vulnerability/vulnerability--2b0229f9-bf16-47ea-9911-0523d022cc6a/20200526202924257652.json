    "description": "The locale_accept_from_http function in ext/intl/locale/locale_methods.c in PHP before 5.5.38, 5.6.x before 5.6.24, and 7.x before 7.0.9 does not properly restrict calls to the ICU uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long argument."
