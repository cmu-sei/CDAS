    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Mobile Devices (aka MDI) C4 OBD-II dongles with firmware 2.x and 3.4.x, as used in Metromile Pulse and other products, store SSH private keys that are the same across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another installation.  NOTE: the vendor states \"\"This was a flaw for the developer/debugging devices (again not possible in production versions)."
