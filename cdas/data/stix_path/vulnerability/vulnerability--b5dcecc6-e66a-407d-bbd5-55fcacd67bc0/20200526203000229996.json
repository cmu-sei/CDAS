    "name": "CVE-2019-13456",
    "description": "In FreeRADIUS 3.0 through 3.0.19, on average 1 in every 2048 EAP-pwd handshakes fails because the password element cannot be found within 10 iterations of the hunting and pecking loop. This leaks information that an attacker can use to recover the password of any user. This information leakage is similar to the \"\"Dragonblood\"\" attack and CVE-2019-9494."
