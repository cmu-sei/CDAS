    "description": "The recv_files function in receiver.c in the daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, proceeds with certain file metadata updates before checking for a filename in the daemon_filter_list data structure, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions."
