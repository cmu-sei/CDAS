    "description": "The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408."
