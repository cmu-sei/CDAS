    "description": "An issue was discovered in the OpenWebif plugin through 1.2.4 for E2 open devices. The saveConfig function of \"\"plugin/controllers/models/config.py\"\" performs an eval() call on the contents of the \"\"key\"\" HTTP GET parameter. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary Python code or OS commands via api/saveconfig."
