    "description": "The dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-wccp.c in the WCCP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not prevent the conflicting use of a table for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet."
