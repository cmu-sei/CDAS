    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in SolrResourceLoader in Apache Solr before 4.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) or full pathname in the tr parameter to solr/select/, when the response writer (wt parameter) is set to XSLT.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using a separate XXE (XML eXternal Entity) vulnerability to allow access to files across restricted network boundaries."
