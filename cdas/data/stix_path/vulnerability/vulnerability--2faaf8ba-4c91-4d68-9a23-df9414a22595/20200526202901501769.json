    "description": "Unlock.exe in Media Encryption EPM Explorer in Check Point Endpoint Security through E80.50 does not associate password failures with a device ID, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to bypass the device-locking protection mechanism by overwriting DVREM.EPM with a copy of itself after each few password guesses."
