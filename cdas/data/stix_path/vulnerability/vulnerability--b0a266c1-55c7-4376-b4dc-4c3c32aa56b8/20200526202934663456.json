    "description": "In wma_ndp_end_response_event_handler(), the variable len_end_rsp is a uint32 which can be overflowed if the value of variable \"\"event->num_ndp_end_rsp_per_ndi_list\"\" is very large which can then lead to a heap overwrite of the heap object end_rsp in all Android releases from CAF (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) using the Linux Kernel."
