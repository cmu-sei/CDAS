    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected system does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to a user of the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the system and perform unauthorized actions."
