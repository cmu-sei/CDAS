    "description": "The org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation in JBoss Security in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before 6.3.3 uses the default security domain when a security domain is undefined, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging credentials on the default domain for a role that is also on the application domain."
