    "description": "slapd in OpenLDAP 2.4.45 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a \"\"kill `cat /pathname`\"\" command, as demonstrated by openldap-initscript."
