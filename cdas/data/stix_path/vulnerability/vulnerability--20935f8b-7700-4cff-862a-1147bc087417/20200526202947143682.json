    "description": "A flaw was found in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel before version kernel-4.15-rc4. The \"\"null skcipher\"\" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges."
