    "description": "The kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 do not properly restrict the availability of address information during a function call, which makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application, aka \"\"Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability."
