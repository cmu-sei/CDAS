    "description": "Bitmessage PyBitmessage version v0.6.2 (and introduced in or after commit 8ce72d8d2d25973b7064b1cf76a6b0b3d62f0ba0) contains a Eval injection vulnerability in main program, file src/messagetypes/__init__.py function constructObject that can result in Code Execution. This attack appears to be exploitable via remote attacker using a malformed message which must be processed by the victim - e.g. arrive from any sender on bitmessage network. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in v0.6.3."
