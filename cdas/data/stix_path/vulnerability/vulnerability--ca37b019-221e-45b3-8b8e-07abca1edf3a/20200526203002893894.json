    "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger high CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. An successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects version 2.1."
