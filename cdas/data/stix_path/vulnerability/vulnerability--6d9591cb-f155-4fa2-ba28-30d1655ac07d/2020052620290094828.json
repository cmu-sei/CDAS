    "description": "The udp6_ufo_fragment function in net/ipv6/udp_offload.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12, when UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) is enabled, does not properly perform a certain size comparison before inserting a fragment header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a large IPv6 UDP packet, as demonstrated by use of the Token Bucket Filter (TBF) queueing discipline."
