    "description": "TypedArrayObject.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 28.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.4, Thunderbird before 24.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.25 does not prevent a zero-length transition during use of an ArrayBuffer object, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap-based out-of-bounds write or read) via a crafted web site."
