    "description": "SAP NetWeaver (Knowledge Management), versions (KMC-CM - 7.00, 7.01, 7.02, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 and KMC-WPC 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50), does not sufficiently validate path information provided by users, thus characters representing traverse to parent directory are passed through to the file APIs, allowing the attacker to overwrite, delete, or corrupt arbitrary files on the remote server, leading to Path Traversal."
