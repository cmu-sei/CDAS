    "description": "The multi-block feature in the ssl3_write_bytes function in s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a on 64-bit x86 platforms with AES NI support does not properly handle certain non-blocking I/O cases, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (pointer corruption and application crash) via unspecified vectors."
