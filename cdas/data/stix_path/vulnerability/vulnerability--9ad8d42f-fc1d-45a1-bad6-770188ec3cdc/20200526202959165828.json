    "description": "When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a special JXR file, the StreamCalcIFDSize function of JXRMeta.c repeatedly calls itself due to improper processing of the file, eventually causing stack exhaustion. An attacker can achieve a remote denial of service attack by sending a specially constructed file."
