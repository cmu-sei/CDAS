    "description": "An exploitable integer overflow exists in the 'CustomData' Mesh loading functionality of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite. A .blend file with a specially crafted external data file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to edit an object within a .blend library in their Scene in order to trigger this vulnerability."
