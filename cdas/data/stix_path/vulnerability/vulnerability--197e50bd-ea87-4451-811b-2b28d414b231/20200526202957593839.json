    "description": "It was found that Keycloak's SAML broker, versions up to 6.0.1, did not verify missing message signatures. If an attacker modifies the SAML Response and removes the <Signature> sections, the message is still accepted, and the message can be modified. An attacker could use this flaw to impersonate other users and gain access to sensitive information."
