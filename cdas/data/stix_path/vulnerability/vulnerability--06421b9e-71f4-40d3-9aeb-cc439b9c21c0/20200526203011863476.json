    "description": "It has been found in openshift-enterprise version 3.11 and all openshift-enterprise versions from 4.1 to, including 4.3, that multiple containers modify the permissions of /etc/passwd to make them modifiable by users other than root. An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this to modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges. This CVE is specific to the openshift/mysql-apb."
