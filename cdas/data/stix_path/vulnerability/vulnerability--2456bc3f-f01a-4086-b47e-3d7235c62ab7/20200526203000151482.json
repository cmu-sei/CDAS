    "description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability in the CRUDLab WP Like Button plugin through 1.6.0 for WordPress allows unauthenticated attackers to change settings. The contains() function in wp_like_button.php did not check if the current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any unauthenticated user to successfully update settings, as demonstrated by the wp-admin/admin.php?page=facebook-like-button each_page_url or code_snippet parameter."
