    "description": "The Windows-based Host Interface Program (WHIP) service on Huawei SmartAX MT882 devices V200R002B022 Arg relies on the client to send a length field that is consistent with a buffer size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device outage) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted traffic on TCP port 8701."
