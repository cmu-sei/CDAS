    "description": "SaferVPN 4.2.5 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its \"\"SaferVPN.Service\"\" service. The \"\"SaferVPN.Service\"\" service executes \"\"openvpn.exe\"\" using OpenVPN config files located within the current user's %LOCALAPPDATA%\\SaferVPN\\OvpnConfig directory. An authenticated attacker may modify these configuration files to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user."
