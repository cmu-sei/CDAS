    "name": "CVE-2017-9687",
    "description": "In Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, two concurrent threads/processes can write the value of \"\"0\"\" to the debugfs file that controls ipa ipc log which will lead to the double-free in ipc_log_context_destroy(). Another issue is the Use-After-Free which can happen due to the race condition when the ipc log is deallocated via the debugfs call during a log print."
