    "description": "In Wikibase Wikidata Query Service GUI before 0.3.6-SNAPSHOT 2019-11-07, when mathematical expressions in results are displayed directly, arbitrary JavaScript execution can occur, aka XSS. This was addressed by introducing MathJax as a new mathematics rendering engine. NOTE: this GUI code is no longer bundled with the Wikibase Wikidata Query Service snapshots, such as 0.3.6-SNAPSHOT."
