    "description": "The Meeting Server in IBM Sametime 8.x through 8.5.2.1 and 9.x through 9.0.0.1 does not send the HSTS Strict-Transport-Security header, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information by leveraging the presence of HTTP requests."
