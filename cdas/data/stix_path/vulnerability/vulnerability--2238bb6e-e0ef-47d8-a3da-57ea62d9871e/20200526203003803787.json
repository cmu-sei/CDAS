    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to disconnect clients that are connected to the guest network on an affected router. The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the URL for device disconnection and providing the connected device information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny service to specific clients that are connected to the guest network."
