    "name": "CVE-2014-0017",
    "description": "The RAND_bytes function in libssh before 0.6.3, when forking is enabled, does not properly reset the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which causes the state to be shared between children processes and allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a pid collision."
