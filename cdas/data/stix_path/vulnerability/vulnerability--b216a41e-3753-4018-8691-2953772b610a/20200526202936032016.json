    "description": "The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.8 is too late in obtaining a certain lock and consequently cannot ensure that disconnect function calls are safe, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging access to the protocol value of IPPROTO_ICMP in a socket system call."
