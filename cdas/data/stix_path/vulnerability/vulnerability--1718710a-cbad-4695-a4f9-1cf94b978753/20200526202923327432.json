    "description": "The AllowCrossRendererResourceLoad function in extensions/browser/url_request_util.cc in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly use an extension's manifest.json web_accessible_resources field for restrictions on IFRAME elements, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks, and trick users into changing extension settings, via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5162."
