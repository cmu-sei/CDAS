    "description": "WellinTech KingSCADA before 3.1.2, KingAlarm&Event before 3.1, and KingGraphic before 3.1.2 perform authentication on the KAEClientManager console rather than on the server, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and discover credentials via a crafted packet to TCP port 8130."
