    "description": "IBM WebSphere Commerce Enterprise 5.6.x through 5.6.1.5, 6.0.x through 6.0.0.11, and 7.0.x through 7.0.0.7 does not use a suitable encryption algorithm for storefront web requests, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a padding oracle attack that targets certain UTF-8 processing of the krypto parameter, and leverages unspecified browser access or traffic-log access."
