    "description": "The Serf RA layer in Apache Subversion 1.4.0 through 1.7.x before 1.7.18 and 1.8.x before 1.8.10 does not properly handle wildcards in the Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a crafted certificate."
