    "description": "Asterisk Open Source 1.8 before 1.8.32.3, 11.x before 11.17.1, 12.x before 12.8.2, and 13.x before 13.3.2 and Certified Asterisk 1.8.28 before 1.8.28-cert5, 11.6 before 11.6-cert11, and 13.1 before 13.1-cert2, when registering a SIP TLS device, does not properly handle a null byte in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority."
