    "description": "Multiple local privilege escalation vulnerabilities have been identified in the LiquidVPN client through 1.37 for macOS. An attacker can communicate with an unprotected XPC service and directly execute arbitrary OS commands as root or load a potentially malicious kernel extension because com.smr.liquidvpn.OVPNHelper uses the value of the \"\"tun_path\"\" or \"\"tap_path\"\" pathname in a kextload() call."
