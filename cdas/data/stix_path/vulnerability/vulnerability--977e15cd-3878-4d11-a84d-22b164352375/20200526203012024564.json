    "description": "Secdo tries to execute a script at a hardcoded path if present, which allows a local authenticated user with 'create folders or append data' access to the root of the OS disk (C:\\) to gain system privileges if the path does not already exist or is writable. This issue affects all versions of Secdo for Windows."
