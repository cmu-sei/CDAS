    "description": "The get_app_path function in desktop/unx/source/start.c in LibreOffice through 6.0.5 mishandles the realpath function in certain environments such as FreeBSD libc, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact if LibreOffice is automatically launched during web browsing with pathnames controlled by a remote web site."
