    "description": "The SVG filter implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 22.0, Firefox ESR 17.x before 17.0.7, Thunderbird before 17.0.7, and Thunderbird ESR 17.x before 17.0.7 allows remote attackers to read pixel values, and possibly bypass the Same Origin Policy and read text from a different domain, by observing timing differences in execution of filter code."
