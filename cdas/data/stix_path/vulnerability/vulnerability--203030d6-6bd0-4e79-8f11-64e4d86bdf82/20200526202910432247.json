    "description": "In Android before 2018-04-05 or earlier security patch level on Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SD 400 and SD 800, in drmprov_cmd_verify_key(), the variable feature_name_length is not validated. There is a check for feature_name_len + filePathLen but there might be an integer wrap when checking feature_name_len + filePathLen. This leads to a buffer overflow."
