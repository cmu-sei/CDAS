    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in system/workplace/admin/accounts/user_role.jsp in OpenCMS 10.5.3 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrative users for requests that perform privilege escalation. Note: It is argued that OpenCMS allows only registered users to upload different kind of content artifacts (SVG, .doc, .docx). The uploaded content is stored in the CMS content repository \"\"as is\"\". In case of scripts inside an SVG, this may or may not be \"\"malicious\"\", there is no way of knowing if the uploaded SVG contains the script for a reason. To exploit the \"\"issue\"\", a user must have an account in the CMS as a content manager."
