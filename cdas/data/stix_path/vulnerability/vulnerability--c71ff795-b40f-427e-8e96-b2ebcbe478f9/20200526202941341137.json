    "description": "The Comcast firmware on Cisco DPC3939 (firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421733-160420a-CMCST) and DPC3939 (firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST) devices sets the CM MAC address to a value with a two-byte offset from the MTA/VoIP MAC address, which indirectly allows remote attackers to discover hidden Home Security Wi-Fi networks by leveraging the embedding of the MTA/VoIP MAC address into the DNS hostname."
