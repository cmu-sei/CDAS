    "description": "Huawei smart phones with software earlier than Vicky-AL00AC00B172D versions have a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass security vulnerability. When re-configuring the mobile phone using the factory reset protection (FRP) function, an attacker can login the Talkback mode and can perform some operations to bypass the Google account verification. As a result, the FRP function is bypassed."
