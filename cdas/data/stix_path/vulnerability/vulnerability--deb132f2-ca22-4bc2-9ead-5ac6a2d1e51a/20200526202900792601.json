    "description": "The X509Extension in pyOpenSSL before 0.13.1 does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority."
