    "description": "In the Linux kernel before version 4.12, Kerberos 5 tickets decoded when using the RXRPC keys incorrectly assumes the size of a field. This could lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going over the end of the buffer. This could possibly lead to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation."
