    "description": "An issue was discovered in Zuul 3.x before 3.1.0. If nodes become offline during the build, the no_log attribute of a task is ignored. If the unreachable error occurred in a task used with a loop variable (e.g., with_items), the contents of the loop items would be printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally leaking credentials or secrets."
