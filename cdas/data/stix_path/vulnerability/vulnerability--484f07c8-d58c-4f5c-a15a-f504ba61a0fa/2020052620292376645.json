    "description": "There are few web pages associated with the genie app on the Netgear WNDR4500 running firmware version V1.0.1.40_1.0.6877. Genie app adds some capabilities over the Web GUI and can be accessed even when you are away from home. A remote attacker can access genie_ping.htm or genie_ping2.htm or genie_ping3.htm page without authentication. Once accessed, the page will be redirected to the aCongratulations2.htma page, which reveals some sensitive information such as 2.4GHz & 5GHz Wireless Network Name (SSID) and Network Key (Password) in clear text."
