    "description": "The installation functionality in the Novell Kanaka component before 2.8 for Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES) on Mac OS X does not verify the server's X.509 certificate during an SSL session, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary certificate."
