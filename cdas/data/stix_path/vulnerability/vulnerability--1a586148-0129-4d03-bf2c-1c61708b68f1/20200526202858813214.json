    "description": "The kvm_set_msr_common function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not ensure a required time_page alignment during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application."
