    "description": "The dtls1_clear_queues function in ssl/d1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h frees data structures without considering that application data can arrive between a ChangeCipherSpec message and a Finished message, which allows remote DTLS peers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unexpected application data."
