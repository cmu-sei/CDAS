    "description": "The EJB invocation handler implementation in Red Hat JBossWS, as used in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before 6.2.0, does not properly enforce the method level restrictions for JAX-WS Service endpoints, which allows remote authenticated users to access otherwise restricted JAX-WS handlers by leveraging permissions to the EJB class."
