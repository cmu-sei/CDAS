    "description": "A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for the Cisco Email Security Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to run out of memory and stop scanning and forwarding email messages. When system memory is depleted, it can cause the filtering process to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. This vulnerability affects software version 9.0 through the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances, both virtual and hardware appliances, if the software is configured to apply a message filter or content filter to incoming email attachments. The vulnerability is not limited to any specific rules or actions for a message filter or content filter. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd29354."
