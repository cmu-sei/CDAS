    "description": "In Android before 2018-04-05 or earlier security patch level on Qualcomm Snapdragon Automobile, Snapdragon Mobile, and Snapdragon Wear IPQ4019, MDM9206, MDM9607, MDM9650, MSM8909W, SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 400, SD 410/12, SD 425, SD 430, SD 450, SD 615/16/SD 415, SD 617, SD 625, SD 650/52, SD 808, SD 810, SD 820, SD 820A, SD 835, SD 845, and SD 850, DRM provisioning mechanisms used in QSEE applications have a feature to prevent further provisioning. This is done by creating an SFS file called 'finalize_prov_flag.data' at the end of provisioning. When this feature is enabled, provisioning calls check for the existence of the file in order to decide whether to do provisioning or not. Current implementation allows provisioning without sufficient checks."
