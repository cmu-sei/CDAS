    "description": "libnetcore in Apple iOS before 8.1.3, Apple OS X before 10.10.2, and Apple TV before 7.0.3 does not verify that certain values have the expected data type, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in an _networkd context via a crafted XPC message from a sandboxed app, as demonstrated by lack of verification of the XPC dictionary data type."
