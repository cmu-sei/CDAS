    "description": "An exploitable Denial of Service vulnerability exists in the API daemon of Circle with Disney running firmware 2.0.1. A large amount of simultaneous TCP connections causes the APID daemon to repeatedly fork, causing the daemon to run out of memory and trigger a device reboot. An attacker needs network connectivity to the device to trigger this vulnerability."
