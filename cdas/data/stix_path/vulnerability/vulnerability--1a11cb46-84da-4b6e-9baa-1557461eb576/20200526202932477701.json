    "description": "The baseband modules of Mate 10, Mate 10 Pro, Mate 9, Mate 9 Pro Huawei smart phones with software before ALP-AL00 8.0.0.120(SP2C00), before BLA-AL00 8.0.0.120(SP2C00), before MHA-AL00B 8.0.0.334(C00), and before LON-AL00B 8.0.0.334(C00) have a stack overflow vulnerability due to the lack of parameter validation. An attacker could send malicious packets to the smart phones within radio range by special wireless device, which leads stack overflow when the baseband module handles these packets. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform a denial of service attack or remote code execution in baseband module."
