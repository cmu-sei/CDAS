    "description": "deepin-clone before 1.1.3 uses a fixed path /tmp/partclone.log in the Helper::getPartitionSizeInfo() function to write a log file as root, and follows symlinks there. An unprivileged user can prepare a symlink attack there to create or overwrite files in arbitrary file system locations. The content is not attacker controlled."
