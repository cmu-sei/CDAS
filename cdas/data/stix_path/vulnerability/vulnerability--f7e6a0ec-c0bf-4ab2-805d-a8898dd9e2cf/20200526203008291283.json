    "description": "An issue was discovered in /bin/goahead on D-Link DIR-823G devices with firmware 1.02B03. There is incorrect access control allowing remote attackers to get sensitive information (such as MAC address) about all clients in the WLAN via the GetClientInfo HNAP API. Consequently, an attacker can achieve information disclosure without authentication."
