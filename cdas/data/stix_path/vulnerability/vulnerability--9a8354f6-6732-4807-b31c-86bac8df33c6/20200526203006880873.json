    "description": "An exploitable stack buffer overflow vulnerability vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service &#8216;I/O-Check&#8217; functionality of WAGO PFC 200 Firmware version 03.02.02(14). A specially crafted XML cache file written to a specific location on the device can cause a stack buffer overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file. The destination buffer sp+0x440 is overflowed with the call to sprintf() for any subnetmask values that are greater than 1024-len(&#8216;/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=enabled subnet-mask=&#8216;) in length. A subnetmask value of length 0x3d9 will cause the service to crash."
