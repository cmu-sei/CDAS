    "description": "The virConnectDomainXMLToNative API function in libvirt 1.1.0 through 1.1.3 checks for the connect:read permission instead of the connect:write permission, which allows attackers to gain domain:write privileges and execute Qemu binaries via crafted XML.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information."
