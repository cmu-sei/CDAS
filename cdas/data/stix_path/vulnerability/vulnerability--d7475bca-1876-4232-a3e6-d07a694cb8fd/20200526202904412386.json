    "description": "Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 do not properly restrict the exchange of keyboard and mouse data between programs at different integrity levels, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging control over a low-integrity process to launch the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) and then upload a crafted application, aka \"\"On-Screen Keyboard Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability."
