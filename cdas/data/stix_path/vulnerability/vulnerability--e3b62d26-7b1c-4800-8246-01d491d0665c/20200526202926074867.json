    "description": "A vulnerability was found in foreman 1.14.0. When creating an organization or location in Foreman, if the name contains HTML then the second step of the wizard (/organizations/id/step2) will render the HTML. This occurs in the alertbox on the page. The result is a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with HTML in the name is created, then a user is linked directly to this URL."
