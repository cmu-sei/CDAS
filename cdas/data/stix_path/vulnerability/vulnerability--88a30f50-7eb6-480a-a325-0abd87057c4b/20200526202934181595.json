This arbitrary file write vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite a specific executable in the Dolphin Browser's data directory with a crafted malicious executable. Every time the Dolphin Browser is launched, it will attempt to run the malicious executable from disk, thus executing the attacker's code."
