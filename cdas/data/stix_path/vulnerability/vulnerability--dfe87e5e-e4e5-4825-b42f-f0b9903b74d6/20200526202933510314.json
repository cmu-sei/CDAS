    "description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality in the YAMLParser method in Interfaces.py in PyAnyAPI before 0.6.1. A YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability."
