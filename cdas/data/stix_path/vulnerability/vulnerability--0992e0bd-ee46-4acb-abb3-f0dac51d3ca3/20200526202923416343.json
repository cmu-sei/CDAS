    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 48.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.3 process JavaScript event-handler attributes of a MARQUEE element within a sandboxed IFRAME element that lacks the sandbox=\"\"allow-scripts\"\" attribute value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted web site."
