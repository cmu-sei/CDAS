    "description": "The PointerCompare function in codegen.cc in Seccomp-BPF, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.131 on Windows and OS X and before 34.0.1847.132 on Linux, does not properly merge blocks, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended sandbox restrictions by leveraging renderer access."
