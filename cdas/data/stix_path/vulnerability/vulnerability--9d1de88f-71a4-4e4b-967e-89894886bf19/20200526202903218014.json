    "description": "VBox/GuestHost/OpenGL/util/net.c in Oracle VirtualBox before 3.2.22, 4.0.x before 4.0.24, 4.1.x before 4.1.32, 4.2.x before 4.2.24, and 4.3.x before 4.3.8, when using 3D Acceleration allows local guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the Chromium server via crafted Chromium network pointer in a (1) CR_MESSAGE_READBACK or (2) CR_MESSAGE_WRITEBACK message to the VBoxSharedCrOpenGL service, which triggers an arbitrary pointer dereference and memory corruption.  NOTE: this issue was MERGED with CVE-2014-0982 because it is the same type of vulnerability affecting the same set of versions. All CVE users should reference CVE-2014-0981 instead of CVE-2014-0982."
