    "description": "In BMC Patrol before 9.13.10.02, the binary \"\"listguests64\"\" is configured with the setuid bit. However, when executing it, it will look for a binary named \"\"virsh\"\" using the PATH environment variable. The \"\"listguests64\"\" program will then run \"\"virsh\"\" using root privileges. This allows local users to elevate their privileges to root."
