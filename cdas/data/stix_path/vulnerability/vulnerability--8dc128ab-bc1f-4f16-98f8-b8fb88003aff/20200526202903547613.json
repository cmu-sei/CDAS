    "description": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 27.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.24 operates on XSLT stylesheets according to style-src directives instead of script-src directives, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary XSLT code by leveraging insufficient style-src restrictions."
