    "description": "An issue was discovered in Froxlor through 0.10.15. The installer wrote configuration parameters including passwords into files in /tmp, setting proper permissions only after writing the sensitive data. A local attacker could have disclosed the information if he read the file at the right time, because of _createUserdataConf in install/lib/class.FroxlorInstall.php."
