    "description": "An issue was discovered in Hola 1.79.859. An unprivileged user could modify or overwrite the executable with arbitrary code, which would be executed the next time the service is started. Depending on the user that the service runs as, this could result in privilege escalation. The issue exists because of the SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS access right for the hola_svc and hola_updater services."
