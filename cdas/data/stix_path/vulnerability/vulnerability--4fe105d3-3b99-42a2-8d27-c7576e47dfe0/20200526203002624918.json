    "description": "An issue was discovered in Decentralized Anonymous Payment System (DAPS) through 2019-08-26. It is possible to force wallets to send HTTP requests to arbitrary locations, both on the local network and on the internet. This is a serious threat to user privacy, since it can possibly leak their IP address and the fact that they are using the product. This also affects Dash Core through 0.14.0.3 and Private Instant Verified Transactions (PIVX) through 3.4.0."
