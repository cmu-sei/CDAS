    "description": "Anviz Global M3 Outdoor RFID Access Control executes any command received from any source. No authentication/encryption is done. Attackers can fully interact with the device: for example, send the \"\"open door\"\" command, download the users list (which includes RFID codes and passcodes in cleartext), or update/create users. The same attack can be executed on a local network and over the internet (if the device is exposed on a public IP address)."
