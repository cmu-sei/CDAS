    "description": "An issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was observed in the \"\"decode_ne_resource_id\"\" function in the \"\"restable.c\"\" source file. This is happening because the \"\"len\"\" parameter for memcpy is not checked for size and thus becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects wrestool."
