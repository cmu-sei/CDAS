    "description": "The SSH implementation on IBM Security Access Manager for Web appliances 7.0 before 7.0.0 FP19, 8.0 before 8.0.1.3 IF3, and 9.0 before 9.0.0.0 IF1 does not properly restrict the set of MAC algorithms, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors."
