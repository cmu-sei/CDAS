    "description": "The is_asn1 function in strongSwan 4.1.11 through 5.0.4 does not properly validate the return value of the asn1_length function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a (1) XAuth username, (2) EAP identity, or (3) PEM encoded file that starts with a 0x04, 0x30, or 0x31 character followed by an ASN.1 length value that triggers an integer overflow."
