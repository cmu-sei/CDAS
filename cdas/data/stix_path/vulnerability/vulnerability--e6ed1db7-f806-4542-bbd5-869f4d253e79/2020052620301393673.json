    "description": "The WP Database Backup plugin through 5.5 for WordPress stores downloads by default locally in the directory wp-content/uploads/db-backup/. This might allow attackers to read ZIP archives by guessing random ID numbers, guessing date strings with a 2020_{0..1}{0..2}_{0..3}{0..9} format, guessing UNIX timestamps, and making HTTPS requests with the complete guessed URL."
