    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Stapler web framework used by Jenkins 2.145 and earlier, LTS 2.138.1 and earlier in core/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/stapler/Facet.java, groovy/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/stapler/jelly/groovy/GroovyFacet.java, jelly/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/stapler/jelly/JellyFacet.java, jruby/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/stapler/jelly/jruby/JRubyFacet.java, jsp/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/stapler/jsp/JSPFacet.java that allows attackers to render routable objects using any view in Jenkins, exposing internal information about those objects not intended to be viewed, such as their toString() representation."
