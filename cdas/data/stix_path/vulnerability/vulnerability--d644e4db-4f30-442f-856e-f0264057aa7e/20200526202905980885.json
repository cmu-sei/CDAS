    "description": "EMC RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite (MES) 4.0.x before 4.0.6 and RSA BSAFE SSL-J before 6.1.4 do not ensure that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before renegotiation, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information or modify TLS session data via a \"\"triple handshake attack."
