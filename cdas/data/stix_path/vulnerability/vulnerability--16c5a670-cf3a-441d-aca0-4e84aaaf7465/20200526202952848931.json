    "description": "An exploitable HTTP header injection vulnerability exists in the remote servers of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 - Firmware version 0.20.17. The hubCore process listens on port 39500 and relays any unauthenticated message to SmartThings' remote servers, which insecurely handle JSON messages, leading to partially controlled requests generated toward the internal video-core process. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability."
