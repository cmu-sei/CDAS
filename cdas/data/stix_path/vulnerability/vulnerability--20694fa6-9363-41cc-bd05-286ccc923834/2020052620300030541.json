    "description": "In IntelliSpace Perinatal, Versions K and prior, a vulnerability within the IntelliSpace Perinatal application environment could enable an unauthorized attacker with physical access to a locked application screen, or an authorized remote desktop session host application user to break-out from the containment of the application and access unauthorized resources from the Windows operating system as the limited-access Windows user. Due to potential Windows vulnerabilities, it may be possible for additional attack methods to be used to escalate privileges on the operating system."
