    "description": "An XSS vulnerability exists in modules/wysiwyg/save.php of LeptonCMS 4.5.0. This can be exploited because the only security measure used against XSS is the stripping of SCRIPT elements. A malicious actor can use HTML event handlers to run JavaScript instead of using SCRIPT elements."
