    "description": "A vulnerability in the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) bitstream processing of the Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming RTP bitstreams. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RTP bitstream to an affected Cisco Meeting Server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny audio and video services by causing media process crashes resulting in a DoS condition on the affected product. This vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server deployments that are running Cisco Meeting Server Software Releases 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve79693, CSCvf91393, CSCvg64656, CSCvh30725, CSCvi86363."
