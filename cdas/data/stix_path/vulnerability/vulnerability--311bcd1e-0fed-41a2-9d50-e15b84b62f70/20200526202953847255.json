    "description": "On F5 BIG-IP 13.0.0-13.1.0.5, 12.1.0-12.1.3.3, or 11.2.1-11.6.3.1, administrative users by way of undisclosed methods can exploit the ssldump utility to write to arbitrary file paths. For users who do not have Advanced Shell access (for example, any user when licensed for Appliance Mode), this allows more permissive file access than intended."
