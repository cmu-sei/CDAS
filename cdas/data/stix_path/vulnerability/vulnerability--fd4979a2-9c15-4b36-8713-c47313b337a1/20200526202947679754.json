    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and displayed in certain web pages of the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link or view an affected log file. The injected script code may be executed in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information."
