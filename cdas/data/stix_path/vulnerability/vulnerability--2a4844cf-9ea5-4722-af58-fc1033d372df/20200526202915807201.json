    "description": "The SoapClient __call method in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.45, 5.5.x before 5.5.29, and 5.6.x before 5.6.13 does not properly manage headers, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized data that triggers a \"\"type confusion\"\" in the serialize_function_call function."
