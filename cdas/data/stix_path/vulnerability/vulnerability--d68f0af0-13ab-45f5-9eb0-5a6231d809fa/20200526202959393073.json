    "description": "A stack-based buffer over-read exists in PostScriptFunction::transform in Function.cc in Xpdf 4.01.01 because GfxSeparationColorSpace and GfxDeviceNColorSpace mishandle tint transform functions. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftops tool. It might allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service or leak memory data."
