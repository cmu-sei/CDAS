    "description": "An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the /cameras/XXXX/clips handler of video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub with Firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. The strncpy call overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 52 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"\"callbackUrl\"\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability."
