    "description": "In FreeBSD before 11.2-STABLE(r340854) and 11.2-RELEASE-p5, the NFS server lacks a bounds check in the READDIRPLUS NFS request. Unprivileged remote users with access to the NFS server can cause a resource exhaustion by forcing the server to allocate an arbitrarily large memory allocation."
