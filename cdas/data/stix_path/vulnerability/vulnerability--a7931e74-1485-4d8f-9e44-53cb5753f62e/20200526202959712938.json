    "name": "CVE-2019-12836",
    "description": "The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover."
