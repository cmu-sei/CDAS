    "description": "Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 shipped with an MCollective configuration that allowed the package plugin to install or remove arbitrary packages on all managed agents. This release adds default configuration to not allow these actions. Customers who rely on this functionality can change this policy."
