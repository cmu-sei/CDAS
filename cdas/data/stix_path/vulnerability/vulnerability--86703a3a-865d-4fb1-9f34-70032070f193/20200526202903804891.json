    "name": "CVE-2014-1928",
    "description": "The shell_quote function in python-gnupg 0.3.5 does not properly escape characters, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors, as demonstrated using \"\"\\\"\" (backslash) characters to form multi-command sequences, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1927.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7323."
