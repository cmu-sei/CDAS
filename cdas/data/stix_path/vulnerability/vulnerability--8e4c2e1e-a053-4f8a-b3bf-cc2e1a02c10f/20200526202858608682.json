    "description": "The dissect_pw_eth_heuristic function in epan/dissectors/packet-pw-eth.c in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not properly handle apparent Ethernet address values at the beginning of MPLS data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loop) via a malformed packet."
