    "description": "CNCF Envoy through 1.13.0 has incorrect Access Control when using SDS with Combined Validation Context. Using the same secret (e.g. trusted CA) across many resources together with the combined validation context could lead to the &#8220;static&#8221; part of the validation context to be not applied, even though it was visible in the active config dump."
