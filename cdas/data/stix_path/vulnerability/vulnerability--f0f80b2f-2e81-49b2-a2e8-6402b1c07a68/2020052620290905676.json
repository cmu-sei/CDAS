    "description": "The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in International Components for Unicode (ICU) before 55.1 uses an integer data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text."
