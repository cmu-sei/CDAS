    "description": "Enigma NMS 65.0.0 and prior allows administrative users to create low-privileged accounts that do not have the ability to modify any settings in the system, only view the components. However, it is possible for a low-privileged user to perform all actions as an administrator by bypassing authorization controls and sending requests to the server in the context of an administrator."
