    "description": "The snd_seq_ioctl_remove_events function in sound/core/seq/seq_clientmgr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.1 does not verify FIFO assignment before proceeding with FIFO clearing, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted ioctl call."
