    "description": "A vulnerability in the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) management connection interface for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the IVR connection to disconnect, creating a system-wide denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a TCP connection request when the IVR connection is already established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a crafted connection to the IP address of the targeted CVP device. An exploit could allow the attacker to disconnect the IVR to CVP connection, creating a DoS condition that prevents the CVP from accepting new, incoming calls while the IVR automatically attempts to re-establish the connection to the CVP. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) Software Release 11.5(1). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve70560."
