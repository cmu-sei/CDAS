    "description": "The directrun function in directmachine.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, does not validate a certain skip operation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font."
