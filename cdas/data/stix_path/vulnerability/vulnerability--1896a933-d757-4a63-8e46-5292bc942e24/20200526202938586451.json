    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) 3.0(1c) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied HTTP input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP POST request that contains crafted, deserialized user data to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges on the affected system, which the attacker could use to conduct further attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14591."
