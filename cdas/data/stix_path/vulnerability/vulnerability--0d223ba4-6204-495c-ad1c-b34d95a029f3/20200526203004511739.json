    "description": "An issue was discovered in Selesta Visual Access Manager (VAM) 4.15.0 through 4.29. A user with valid credentials is able to create and write XML files on the filesystem via /common/vam_editXml.php in the web interface. The vulnerable PHP page checks none of these: the parameter that identifies the file name to be created, the destination path, or the extension. Thus, an attacker can manipulate the file name to create any type of file within the filesystem with arbitrary content."
