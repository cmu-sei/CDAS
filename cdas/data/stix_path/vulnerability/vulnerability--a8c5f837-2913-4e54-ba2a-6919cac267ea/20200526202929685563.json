An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate directly with Apache Solr may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial information. The Apache Solr account name is dms. The password is hard-coded throughout the application, and is the same across all installations. Customers do not have the option to change passwords. The dms account for Apache Solr has access to all indexed patient documents."
