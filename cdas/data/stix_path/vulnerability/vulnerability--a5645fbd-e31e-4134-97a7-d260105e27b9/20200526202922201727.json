    "description": "The fingerprint login feature in Android 6.0.1 before 2016-10-01 and 7.0 before 2016-10-01 does not track the user account during the authentication process, which allows physically proximate attackers to authenticate as an arbitrary user by leveraging lockscreen access, aka internal bug 30744668."
