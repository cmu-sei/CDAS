    "description": "It was discovered that the Dashbuilder login page as used in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite before 6.4.2 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization & Services before 6.4.3 could be opened in an IFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary actions in the Console (clickjacking)."
