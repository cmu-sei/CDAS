    "description": "The TIFFSetProfiles function in coders/tiff.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6 has incorrect expectations about whether LibTIFF TIFFGetField return values imply that data validation has occurred, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free after an invalid call to TIFFSetField, and application crash) via a crafted file."
