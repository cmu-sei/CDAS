    "description": "An issue was discovered in Envoy 1.12.0. An untrusted remote client may send an HTTP header (such as Host) with whitespace after the header content. Envoy will treat \"\"header-value \"\" as a different string from \"\"header-value\"\" so for example with the Host header \"\"example.com \"\" one could bypass \"\"example.com\"\" matchers."
