    "description": "The getObjectByToken function in Newsletter.php in the Pimcore_Tool_Newsletter module in pimcore 1.4.9 through 2.1.0 does not properly handle an object obtained by unserializing a pathname, which allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks and delete arbitrary files via vectors involving a Zend_Http_Response_Stream object."
