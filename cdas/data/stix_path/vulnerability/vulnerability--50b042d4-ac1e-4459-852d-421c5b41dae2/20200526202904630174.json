    "description": "The reverse-proxy feature in IBM Security Access Manager (ISAM) for Web 8.0 with firmware 8.0.0.2 and 8.0.0.3 interprets the jct-nist-compliance parameter in the opposite of the intended manner, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging weak SSL encryption settings that lack NIST SP 800-131A compliance."
