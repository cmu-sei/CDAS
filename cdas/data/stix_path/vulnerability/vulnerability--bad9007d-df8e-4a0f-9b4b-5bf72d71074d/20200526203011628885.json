    "description": "A Windows privilege change issue was discovered in Splashtop Software Updater before 1.5.6.16. Insecure permissions on the configuration file and named pipe allow for local privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM, by forcing a permission change to any Splashtop files and directories, with resultant DLL hijacking. This product is bundled with Splashtop Streamer (before 3.3.8.0) and Splashtop Business (before 3.3.8.0)."
