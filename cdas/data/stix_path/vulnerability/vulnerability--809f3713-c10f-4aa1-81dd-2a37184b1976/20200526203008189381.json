    "description": "An issue was discovered in AODDriver2.sys in AMD OverDrive. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction via IOCTL 0x81112ee0 and does not properly filter the Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges."
