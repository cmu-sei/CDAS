    "description": "CCN-lite 2.0.0 Beta allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact because the ccnl_ndntlv_prependBlob function in ccnl-pkt-ndntlv.c can be called with wrong arguments. Specifically, there is an incorrect integer data type causing a negative third argument in some cases of crafted TLV data with inconsistent length information."
