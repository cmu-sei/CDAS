    "description": "The Form API in Drupal 6.x before 6.38 ignores access restrictions on submit buttons, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging permission to submit a form with a button that has \"\"#access\"\" set to FALSE in the server-side form definition."
