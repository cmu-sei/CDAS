    "description": "An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the crash handler of the hubCore binary of the Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 - Firmware version 0.20.17. When hubCore crashes, Google Breakpad is used to record minidumps, which are sent over an insecure HTTPS connection to the backtrace.io service, leading to the exposure of sensitive data. An attacker can impersonate the remote backtrace.io server in order to trigger this vulnerability."
