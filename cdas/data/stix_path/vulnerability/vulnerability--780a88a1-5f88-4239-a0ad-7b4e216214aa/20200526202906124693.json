    "description": "IBM Cognos Mobile 10.1.1 before FP3 IF1, 10.2.0 before FP2 IF1, and 10.2.1 before FP4 IF1 preserves a session between the Cognos Mobile server and the Cognos Business Intelligence server after a logoff action on a mobile device, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended Business Intelligence restrictions by leveraging access to authentication data that was captured before this logoff."
