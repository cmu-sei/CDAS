    "description": "PureVPN 6.0.1 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its \"\"sevpnclient\"\" service. When configured to use the OpenVPN protocol, the \"\"sevpnclient\"\" service executes \"\"openvpn.exe\"\" using the OpenVPN config file located at %PROGRAMDATA%\\purevpn\\config\\config.ovpn. This file allows \"\"Write\"\" permissions to users in the \"\"Everyone\"\" group. An authenticated attacker may modify this file to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM account."
