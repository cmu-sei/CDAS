    "description": "Wolf CMS before 0.8.3.1 allows unrestricted file rename and PHP Code Execution because admin/plugin/file_manager/browse/ (aka the filemanager) does not prevent a change of a file extension to \"\".php\"\" after originally using the parameter \"\"filename\"\" for uploading a JPEG image. Exploitation requires a registered user who has access to upload functionality."
