    "description": "The ImageInputType::ensurePrimaryContent function in WebKit/Source/core/html/forms/ImageInputType.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.87, does not properly maintain the user agent shadow DOM, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage \"\"type confusion."
