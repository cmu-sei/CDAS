    "description": "The do_search function in ldap/servers/slapd/search.c in 389 Directory Server 1.2.x before 1.2.11.20 and 1.3.x before 1.3.0.5 does not properly restrict access to entries when the nsslapd-allow-anonymous-access configuration is set to rootdse and the BASE search scope is used, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information outside of the rootDSE via a crafted LDAP search."
