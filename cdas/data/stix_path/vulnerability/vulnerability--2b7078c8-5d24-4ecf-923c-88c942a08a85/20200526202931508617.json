    "description": "Honeywell NVR devices allow remote attackers to create a user account in the admin group by leveraging access to a guest account to obtain a session ID, and then sending that session ID in a userManager.addUser request to the /RPC2 URI. The attacker can login to the device with that new user account to fully control the device."
