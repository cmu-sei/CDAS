    "description": "A security vulnerability has been identified in HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen 9, HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen 10, HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen 10 G, HPE SimpliVity 2600 Gen 10, SimpliVity OmniCube, SimpliVity OmniStack for Cisco, SimpliVity OmniStack for Lenovo and SimpliVity OmniStack for Dell nodes. Two now deprecated APIs run as root, accept a file name path, and can be used to create or delete arbitrary files on the nodes. These APIs do not require user authentication and are accessible over the management network, resulting in remote availability and integrity vulnerabilities For all customers running HPE OmniStack version 3.7.9 and earlier. HPE recommends upgrading the OmniStack software to version 3.7.10 or later, which contains a permanent resolution. Customers and partners who can upgrade to 3.7.10 should upgrade at the earliest convenience. For all customers and partners unable to upgrade their environments to the recommended version 3.7.10, HPE has created a Temporary Workaround https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=mmr_sf-EN_US000061675&withFrame for you to implement.
