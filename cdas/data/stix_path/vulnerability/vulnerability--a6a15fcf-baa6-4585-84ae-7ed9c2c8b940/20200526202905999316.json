    "description": "The snd_ctl_elem_add function in sound/core/control.c in the ALSA control implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly maintain the user_ctl_count value, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit bypass) by leveraging /dev/snd/controlCX access for a large number of SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE ioctl calls."
