    "description": "rpc.cgi in Webmin through 1.920 allows authenticated Remote Code Execution via a crafted object name because unserialise_variable makes an eval call. NOTE: the Webmin_Servers_Index documentation states \"\"RPC can be used to run any command or modify any file on a server, which is why access to it must not be granted to un-trusted Webmin users."
