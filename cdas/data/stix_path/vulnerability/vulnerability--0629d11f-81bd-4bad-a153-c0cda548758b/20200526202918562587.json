    "description": "The (1) pipe_read and (2) pipe_write implementations in fs/pipe.c in a certain Linux kernel backport in the linux package before 3.2.73-2+deb7u3 on Debian wheezy and the kernel package before 3.10.0-229.26.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 do not properly consider the side effects of failed __copy_to_user_inatomic and __copy_from_user_inatomic calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application, aka an \"\"I/O vector array overrun.\"\" NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2015-1805."
