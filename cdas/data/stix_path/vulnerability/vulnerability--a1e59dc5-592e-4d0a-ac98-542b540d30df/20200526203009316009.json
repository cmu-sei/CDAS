In the index.php?SMExt=SMFiles URI, the user can upload a .php file to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by 404.php. This can only occur if the administrator neglects to set FileExtensionFilter and there are untrusted user accounts. NOTE: The maintainer states that this is not a vulnerability but a feature used in conjunction with External Modules."
