    "description": "The flush_signal_handlers function in kernel/signal.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.4 preserves the value of the sa_restorer field across an exec operation, which makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application containing a sigaction system call."
