    "description": "The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program."
