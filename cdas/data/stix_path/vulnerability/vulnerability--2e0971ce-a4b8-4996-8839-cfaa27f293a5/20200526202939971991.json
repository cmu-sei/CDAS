    "description": "An issue was discovered in the Cloud Controller API in Cloud Foundry Foundation CAPI-release versions after v1.6.0 and prior to v1.35.0 and cf-release versions after v244 and prior to v268. A carefully crafted CAPI request from a Space Developer can allow them to gain access to files on the Cloud Controller VM for that installation."
