    "description": "Druide Antidote RX, HD, 8 before 8.05.2287, 9 before 9.5.3937 and 10 before 10.1.2147 allows remote attackers to steal NTLM hashes or perform SMB relay attacks upon a direct launch of the product, or upon an indirect launch via an integration such as Chrome, Firefox, Word, Outlook, etc. This occurs because the product attempts to access a share with the PLUG-INS subdomain name; an attacker may be able to use Active Directory Domain Services to register that name."
