    "description": "python-apt only checks the MD5 sums of downloaded files in `Version.fetch_binary()` and `Version.fetch_source()` of apt/package.py in version 1.9.0ubuntu1 and earlier. This allows a man-in-the-middle attack which could potentially be used to install altered packages and has been fixed in versions 1.9.0ubuntu1.2, 1.6.5ubuntu0.1, 1.1.0~beta1ubuntu0.16.04.7, 0.9.3.5ubuntu3+esm2, and 0.8.3ubuntu7.5."
