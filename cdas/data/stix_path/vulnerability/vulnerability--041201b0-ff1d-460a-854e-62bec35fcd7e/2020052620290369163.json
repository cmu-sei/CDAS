    "description": "The raw_cmd_copyout function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly restrict access to certain pointers during processing of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel heap memory by leveraging write access to a /dev/fd device."
