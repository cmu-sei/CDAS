    "description": "The server daemons in Kannel 1.5.0 and earlier create a PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a \"\"kill `cat /pathname`\"\" command, as demonstrated by bearerbox."
