    "description": "The British Airways Entertainment System, as installed on Boeing 777-36N(ER) and possibly other aircraft, does not prevent the USB charging/data-transfer feature from interacting with USB keyboard and mouse devices, which allows physically proximate attackers to conduct unanticipated attacks against Entertainment applications, as demonstrated by using mouse copy-and-paste actions to trigger a Chat buffer overflow or possibly have unspecified other impact."
