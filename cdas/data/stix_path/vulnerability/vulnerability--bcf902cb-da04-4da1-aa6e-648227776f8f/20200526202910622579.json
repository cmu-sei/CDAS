    "description": "The dtls1_listen function in d1_lib.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not properly isolate the state information of independent data streams, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted DTLS traffic, as demonstrated by DTLS 1.0 traffic to a DTLS 1.2 server."
