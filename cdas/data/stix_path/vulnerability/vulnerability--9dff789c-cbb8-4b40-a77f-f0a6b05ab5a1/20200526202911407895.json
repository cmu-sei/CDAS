    "description": "The (1) setreuid and (2) setregid system-call implementations in the kernel in Apple iOS before 8.3, Apple OS X before 10.10.3, and Apple TV before 7.2 do not properly perform privilege drops, which makes it easier for attackers to execute code with unintended user or group privileges via a crafted app."
