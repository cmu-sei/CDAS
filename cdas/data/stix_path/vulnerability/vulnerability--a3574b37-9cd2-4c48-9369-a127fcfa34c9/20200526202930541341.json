    "description": "An Out-of-bounds Read issue was discovered in Smiths Medical Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump, Version 1.1, 1.5, and 1.6. A third-party component used in the pump reads memory out of bounds, causing the communications module to crash. Smiths Medical assesses that the crash of the communications module would not impact the operation of the therapeutic module."
