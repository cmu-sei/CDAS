    "description": "An issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine AssetExplorer 6.5. During an upgrade of the Windows agent, it does not validate the source and binary downloaded. This allows an attacker on an adjacent network to execute code with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges on the agent machines by providing an arbitrary executable via a man-in-the-middle attack."
