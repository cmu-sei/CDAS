    "description": "Google Chrome prior to 56.0.2924.76 for Linux, Windows and Mac, and 56.0.2924.87 for Android, had an insufficiently strict content security policy on the Chrome app launcher page, which allowed a remote attacker to inject scripts or HTML into a privileged page via a crafted HTML page."
