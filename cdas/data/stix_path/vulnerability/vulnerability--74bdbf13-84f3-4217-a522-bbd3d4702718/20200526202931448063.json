    "description": "In the function ReadTXTImage() in coders/txt.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-10, an integer overflow might occur for the addition operation \"\"GetQuantumRange(depth)+1\"\" when \"\"depth\"\" is large, producing a smaller value than expected. As a result, an infinite loop would occur for a crafted TXT file that claims a very large \"\"max_value\"\" value."
