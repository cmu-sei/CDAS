    "description": "IBM Security Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On 8.2.2 does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies.

The cookie will be sent to the insecure link and the attacker can then obtain the cookie value by snooping the traffic. IBM X-Force ID: 134913."
