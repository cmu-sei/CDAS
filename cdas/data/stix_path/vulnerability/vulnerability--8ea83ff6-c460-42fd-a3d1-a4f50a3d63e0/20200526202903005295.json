    "description": "The (1) JSAFE and (2) JSSE APIs in EMC RSA BSAFE SSL-J 5.x before 5.1.3 and 6.x before 6.0.2 make it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended cryptographic protection mechanisms by triggering application-data processing during the TLS handshake, a time at which the data is both unencrypted and unauthenticated."
