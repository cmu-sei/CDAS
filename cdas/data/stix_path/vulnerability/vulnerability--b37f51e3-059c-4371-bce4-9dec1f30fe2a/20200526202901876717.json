    "description": "IBM Platform Symphony 5.2 before build 229037 and 6.1.0.1 before build 229073 uses the same credentials encryption key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging knowledge of this key."
