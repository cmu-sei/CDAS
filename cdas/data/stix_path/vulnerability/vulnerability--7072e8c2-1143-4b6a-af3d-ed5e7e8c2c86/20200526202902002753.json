    "description": "The ec2tokens API in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) before Havana 2013.2.1 and Icehouse before icehouse-2 does not return a trust-scoped token when one is received, which allows remote trust users to gain privileges by generating EC2 credentials from a trust-scoped token and using them in an ec2tokens API request."
