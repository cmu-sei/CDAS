    "description": "The rule-update feature in Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center (MC) 5.2 through 5.4.0.1 does not verify the X.509 certificate of the support.sourcefire.com SSL server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof this server and provide an invalid package, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via a crafted certificate, aka Bug ID CSCuw06444."
