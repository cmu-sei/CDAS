    "description": "Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 before CP 1746 does not sanitize a rest/commonlog/report/template name field, which allows a 'Reports Only' user to inject malicious JavaScript while creating a new report. Additionally, IWSVA implements incorrect access control that allows any authenticated, remote user (even with low privileges like 'Auditor') to create or modify reports, and consequently take advantage of this XSS vulnerability. The JavaScript is executed when victims visit reports or auditlog pages."
