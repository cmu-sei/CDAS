    "description": "The mcf_fec_do_tx function in hw/net/mcf_fec.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) does not properly limit the buffer descriptor count when transmitting packets, which allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and QEMU process crash) via vectors involving a buffer descriptor with a length of 0 and crafted values in bd.flags."
