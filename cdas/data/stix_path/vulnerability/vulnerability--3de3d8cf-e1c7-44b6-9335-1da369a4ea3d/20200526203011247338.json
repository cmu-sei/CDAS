    "name": "CVE-2020-11463",
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Deskpro before 2019.8.0. The /api/email_accounts endpoint failed to properly validate a user's privilege, allowing an attacker to retrieve cleartext credentials of all helpdesk email accounts, including incoming and outgoing email credentials. This enables an attacker to get full access to all emails sent or received by the system including password reset emails, making it possible to reset any user's password."
