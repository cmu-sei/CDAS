    "description": "The FortiManager protocol service in Fortinet FortiOS before 4.3.16 and 5.x before 5.0.8 on FortiGate devices does not prevent use of anonymous ciphersuites, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information or interfere with communications by modifying the client-server data stream."
