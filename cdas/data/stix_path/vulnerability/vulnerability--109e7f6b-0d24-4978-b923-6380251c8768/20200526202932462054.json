    "description": "The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.13.7 mishandles use of add_key for a key that already exists but is uninstantiated, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted system call."
