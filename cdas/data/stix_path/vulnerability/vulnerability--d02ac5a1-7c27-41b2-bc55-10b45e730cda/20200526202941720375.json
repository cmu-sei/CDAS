    "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. A secondary authentication system is available for Installers called the Grid Guard system. This system uses predictable codes, and a single Grid Guard code can be used on any SMA inverter. Any such code, when combined with the installer account, allows changing very sensitive parameters. NOTE: the vendor reports that Grid Guard is not an authentication feature; it is only a tracing feature. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
