    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The validateInputImageSize function in modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp in OpenCV 3.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) because (size.height <= (1<<20)) may be false. Note: &#8220;OpenCV CV_Assert is not an assertion (C-like assert()), it is regular C++ exception which can raised in case of invalid or non-supported parameters.&#8221;"
