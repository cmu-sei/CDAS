    "description": "The Token Insert Entity module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.1 for Drupal does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with certain permissions to bypass intended access restrictions and possibly obtain sensitive information by inserting a token, which embeds a rendered entity in the main node."
