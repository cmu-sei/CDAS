    "description": "A vulnerability in specific CLI commands for the Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The device may need to be manually rebooted to recover. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation of the CLI user input for certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a crafted, malicious CLI command on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition. The attacker must have valid administrative privileges on the device to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf63414, CSCvh51992."
