    "description": "HiveManager Classic through 8.1r1 allows arbitrary JSP code execution by modifying a backup archive before a restore, because the restore feature does not validate pathnames within the archive. An authenticated, local attacker - even restricted as a tenant - can add a jsp at HiveManager/tomcat/webapps/hm/domains/$yourtenant/maps (it will be exposed at the web interface)."
