    "name": "CVE-2013-4852",
    "description": "Integer overflow in PuTTY 0.62 and earlier, WinSCP before 5.1.6, and other products that use PuTTY allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code in certain applications that use PuTTY via a negative size value in an RSA key signature during the SSH handshake, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow."
