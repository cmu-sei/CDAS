    "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered on AudioCodes Mediant 500L-MSBR, 500-MBSR, M800B-MSBR and 800C-MSBR devices with firmware versions F7.20A at least to 7.20A.252.062. The (1) management SSH and (2) management TELNET features allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection slot exhaustion) via 5 unauthenticated connection attempts, because the maximum number of unauthenticated clients that can be configured is 5. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is a \"\"design choice."
