    "description": "UPS companion software v1.05 & Prior is affected by &#8216;Eval Injection&#8217; vulnerability. The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call e.g.&#8221;eval&#8221; in &#8220;Update Manager&#8221; class when software attempts to see if there are updates available. This results in arbitrary code execution on the machine where software is installed."
