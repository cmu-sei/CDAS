    "description": "GSKit in IBM Tivoli Directory Server (ITDS) 6.0 before 6.0.0.73-ISS-ITDS-IF0073, 6.1 before 6.1.0.66-ISS-ITDS-IF0066, 6.2 before 6.2.0.42-ISS-ITDS-IF0042, and 6.3 before 6.3.0.35-ISS-ITDS-IF0035 and IBM Security Directory Server (ISDS) 6.3.1 before 6.3.1.9-ISS-ISDS-IF0009 does not properly restrict TLS state transitions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cipher-downgrade attacks to EXPORT_RSA ciphers via crafted TLS traffic, related to the \"\"FREAK\"\" issue, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-0204."
