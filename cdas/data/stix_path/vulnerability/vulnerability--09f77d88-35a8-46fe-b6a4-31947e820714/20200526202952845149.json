    "description": "An exploitable stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the retrieval of a database field in video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub. The video-core process insecurely extracts the shard.videoHostURL field from its SQLite database, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability."
