    "description": "The Appointment Booking Calendar plugin before 1.3.35 for WordPress allows user input (in fields such as Description or Name) in any booking form to be any formula, which then could be exported via the Bookings list tab in /wp-admin/admin.php?page=cpabc_appointments.php. The attacker could achieve remote code execution via CSV injection."
