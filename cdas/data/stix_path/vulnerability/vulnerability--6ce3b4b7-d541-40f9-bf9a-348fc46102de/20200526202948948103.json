    "name": "CVE-2018-17200",
    "description": "The Apache OFBiz HTTP engine (org.apache.ofbiz.service.engine.HttpEngine.java) handles requests for HTTP services via the /webtools/control/httpService endpoint. This service takes the `serviceContent` parameter in the request and deserializes it using XStream. This `XStream` instance is slightly guarded by disabling the creation of `ProcessBuilder`. However, this can be easily bypassed (and in multiple ways). Mitigation: Upgrade to 16.11.06 or manually apply the following commits on branch 16 r1850017+1850019"
