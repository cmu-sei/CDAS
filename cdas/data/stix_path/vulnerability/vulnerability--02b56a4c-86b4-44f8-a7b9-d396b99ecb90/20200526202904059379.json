    "description": "The nfs_name_snoop_add_name function in epan/dissectors/packet-nfs.c in the NFS dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.13 and 1.10.x before 1.10.6 does not validate a certain length value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted NFS packet."
