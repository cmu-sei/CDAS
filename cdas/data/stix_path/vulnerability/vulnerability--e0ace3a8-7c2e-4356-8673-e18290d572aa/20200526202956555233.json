    "description": "If REST API is enabled, the Junos OS login credentials are vulnerable to brute force attacks. The high default connection limit of the REST API may allow an attacker to brute-force passwords using advanced scripting techniques. Additionally, administrators who do not enforce a strong password policy can increase the likelihood of success from brute force attacks.
