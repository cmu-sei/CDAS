    "description": "Philips e-Alert Unit (non-medical device), Version R2.1 and prior. The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. The Philips e-Alert communication channel is not encrypted which could therefore lead to disclosure of personal contact information and application login credentials from within the same subnet."
