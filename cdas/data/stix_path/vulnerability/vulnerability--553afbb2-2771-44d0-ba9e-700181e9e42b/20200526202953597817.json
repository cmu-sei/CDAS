    "description": "A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a \"\"script-src\"\" policy of \"\"'strict-dynamic'\"\". If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the \"\"require.js\"\" library that is part of Firefox's Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60."
