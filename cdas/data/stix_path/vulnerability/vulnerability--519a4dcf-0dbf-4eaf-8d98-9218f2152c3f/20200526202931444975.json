    "description": "In the mxf_read_primer_pack function in libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, an integer signedness error might occur when a crafted file, which claims a large \"\"item_num\"\" field such as 0xffffffff, is provided. As a result, the variable \"\"item_num\"\" turns negative, bypassing the check for a large value."
