    "description": "The agent and task-agent components in Symantec Management Platform 7.0 and 7.1 before 7.1 SP2 Mp1.1v7 rollup, as used in certain Altiris products, use the same registry-entry encryption key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for local users to obtain sensitive information about package-server access, or cause a denial of service, by leveraging knowledge of this key."
