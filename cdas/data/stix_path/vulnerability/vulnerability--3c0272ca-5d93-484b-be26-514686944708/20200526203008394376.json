    "description": "Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system."
