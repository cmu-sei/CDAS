    "description": "A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in Cisco Jabber for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious DLL file would execute when the Jabber application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another user's account."
