    "description": "The miner statistics HTTP API in EWBF Cuda Zcash Miner Version 0.3.4b hangs on incoming TCP connections until some sort of request is made (such as \"\"GET / HTTP/1.1\"\"), which allows for a Denial of Service attack preventing a user from viewing their mining statistics by an attacker opening a session with telnet or netcat and connecting to the miner on the HTTP API port."
