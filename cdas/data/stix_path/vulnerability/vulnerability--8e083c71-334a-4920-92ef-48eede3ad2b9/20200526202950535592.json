    "name": "CVE-2018-19509",
    "description": "wg7.php in Webgalamb 7.0 makes opportunistic calls to htmlspecialchars() instead of using a templating engine with proper contextual encoding. Because it is possible to insert arbitrary strings into the database, any JavaScript could be executed by the administrator, leading to XSS."
