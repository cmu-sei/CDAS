    "description": "In Golden Frog VyprVPN before 2.15.0.5828 for macOS, the vyprvpnservice launch daemon has an unprotected XPC service that allows attackers to update the underlying OpenVPN configuration and the arguments passed to the OpenVPN binary when executed. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability by forcing the VyprVPN application to load a malicious dynamic library every time a new connection is made."
