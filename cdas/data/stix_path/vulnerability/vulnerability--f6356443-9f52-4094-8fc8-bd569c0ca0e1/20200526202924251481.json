    "description": "The \"\"spiffy-cgi-handlers\"\" egg would convert a nonexistent \"\"Proxy\"\" header to the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which would allow attackers to direct CGI programs which use this environment variable to use an attacker-specified HTTP proxy server (also known as a \"\"httpoxy\"\" attack). This affects all versions of spiffy-cgi-handlers before 0.5."
