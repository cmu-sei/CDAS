    "description": "A file inclusion vulnerability exists in the confd.exe module in Honeywell Experion PKS R40x before R400.6, R41x before R410.6, and R43x before R430.2, which could lead to accepting an arbitrary file into the function, and potential information disclosure or remote code execution. Honeywell strongly encourages and recommends all customers running unsupported versions of EKPS prior to R400 to upgrade to a supported version."
