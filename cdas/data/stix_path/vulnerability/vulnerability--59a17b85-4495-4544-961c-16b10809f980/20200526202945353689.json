    "description": "Symantec Endpoint Protection prior to 14.2 MP1 may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability, which in this case is an issue that can occur when an application being installed unintentionally loads a DLL provided by a potential attacker. Note that this particular type of exploit only manifests at install time; no remediation is required for software that has already been installed. This issue only impacted the Trialware media for Symantec Endpoint Protection, which has since been updated."
