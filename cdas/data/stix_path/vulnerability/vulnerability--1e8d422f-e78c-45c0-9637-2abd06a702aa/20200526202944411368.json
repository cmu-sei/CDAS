    "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Z-BlogPHP 2.0.0. zb_system/cmd.php?act=verify relies on MD5 for the password parameter, which might make it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a dictionary or rainbow-table attack. NOTE: the vendor declined to accept this as a valid issue."
