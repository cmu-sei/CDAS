    "name": "CVE-2013-3704",
    "description": "The RPM GPG key import and handling feature in libzypp 12.15.0 and earlier reports a different key fingerprint than the one used to sign a repository when multiple key blobs are used, which might allow remote attackers to trick users into believing that the repository was signed by a more-trustworthy key."
