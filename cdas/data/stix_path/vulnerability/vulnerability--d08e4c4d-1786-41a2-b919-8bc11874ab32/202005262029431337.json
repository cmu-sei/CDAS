    "description": "Battelle V2I Hub 2.5.1 could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the direct checking of the API key against a user-supplied value in PHP's GET global variable array using PHP's strcmp() function. By adding \"\"[]\"\" to the end of \"\"key\"\" in the URL when accessing API functions, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute API functions."
