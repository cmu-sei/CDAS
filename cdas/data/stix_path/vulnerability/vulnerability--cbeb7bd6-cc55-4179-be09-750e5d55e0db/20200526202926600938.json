    "description": "An issue was discovered in Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1100 controller 1763-L16AWA, Series A and B, Version 14.000 and prior versions; 1763-L16BBB, Series A and B, Version 14.000 and prior versions; 1763-L16BWA, Series A and B, Version 14.000 and prior versions; and 1763-L16DWD, Series A and B, Version 14.000 and prior versions. Because of an Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, users with administrator privileges may be able to remove all administrative users requiring a factory reset to restore ancillary web server function. Exploitation of this vulnerability will still allow the affected device to function in its capacity as a controller."
