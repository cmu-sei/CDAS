    "description": "The auth_gssapi_unwrap_data function in lib/rpc/auth_gssapi_misc.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 does not properly handle partial XDR deserialization, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and double free, and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed XDR data, as demonstrated by data sent to kadmind."
