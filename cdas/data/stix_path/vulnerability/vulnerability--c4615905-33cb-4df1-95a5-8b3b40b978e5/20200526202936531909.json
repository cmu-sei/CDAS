    "description": "D-Link DIR-130 firmware version 1.23 and DIR-330 firmware version 1.12 do not sufficiently protect administrator credentials.

A remote attacker with access to this page (potentially through a authentication bypass such as CVE-2017-3191) may obtain administrator credentials for the device."
