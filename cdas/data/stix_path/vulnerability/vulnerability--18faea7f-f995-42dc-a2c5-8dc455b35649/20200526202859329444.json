    "description": "The deepGetOrCreateNode function in impl/operations/AbstractCreateOperation.java in org.apache.sling.servlets.post.bundle 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 in Apache Sling does not properly handle a NULL value that returned when the session does not have permissions to the root node, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via unspecified vectors."
