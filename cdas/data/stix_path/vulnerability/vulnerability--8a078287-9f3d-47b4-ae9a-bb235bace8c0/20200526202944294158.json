    "description": "An issue was discovered in MyBiz MyProcureNet 5.0.0. A malicious file can be uploaded to the webserver by an attacker. It is possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating system commands. This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the \"\"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions\"\" parameter and add arbitrary extensions to the whitelist during the upload. For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the \"\"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions\"\" parameter, the server accepts \"\"secctest.asp\"\" as a legitimate file. Hence malicious files can be uploaded in order to execute arbitrary commands to take over the server."
