    "description": "Dell Command Update versions prior to 3.1 contain an Arbitrary File Deletion Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges potentially could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files by creating a symlink from the \"\"Temp\\ICProgress\\Dell_InventoryCollector_Progress.xml\"\" to any targeted file. This issue occurs because permissions on the Temp directory were set incorrectly."
