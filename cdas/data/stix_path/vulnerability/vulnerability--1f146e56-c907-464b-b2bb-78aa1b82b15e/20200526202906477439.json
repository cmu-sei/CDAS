    "name": "CVE-2014-5256",
    "description": "Node.js 0.8 before 0.8.28 and 0.10 before 0.10.30 does not consider the possibility of recursive processing that triggers V8 garbage collection in conjunction with a V8 interrupt, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via deep JSON objects whose parsing lets this interrupt mask an overflow of the program stack."
