    "description": "An attacker could send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. At 0x9d01c318 the value for the s_port key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at 0xa00017f4. This buffer is 6 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow. The destination can also be shifted by using an sn_speaker parameter between \"\"0\"\" and \"\"3\"\"."
