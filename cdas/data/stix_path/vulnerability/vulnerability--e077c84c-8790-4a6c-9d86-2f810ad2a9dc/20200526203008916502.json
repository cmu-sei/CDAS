    "description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-878 devices with firmware 1.12A1. This issue is a Command Injection allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, and get a root shell. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 POST request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body for the SetWebFilterSettings API function, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in the WebFilterURLs field."
