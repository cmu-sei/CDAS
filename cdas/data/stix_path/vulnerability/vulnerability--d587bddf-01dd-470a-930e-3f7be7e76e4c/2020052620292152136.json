    "name": "CVE-2016-3125",
    "description": "The mod_tls module in ProFTPD before 1.3.5b and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc2 does not properly handle the TLSDHParamFile directive, which might cause a weaker than intended Diffie-Hellman (DH) key to be used and consequently allow attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors."
