    "description": "DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS 6.0.6/1a, 6.0.2/1a, 5.5.7/12b, 5.5.0/1b-p1, and possibly other versions, does not set the secure flag for an unspecified cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session."
