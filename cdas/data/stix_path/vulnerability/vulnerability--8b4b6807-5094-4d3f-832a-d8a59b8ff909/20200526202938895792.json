    "description": "An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. macOS before 10.12.5 is affected. The issue involves the \"\"802.1X\"\" component. It allows remote attackers to discover the network credentials of arbitrary users by operating a crafted network that requires 802.1X authentication, because EAP-TLS certificate validation mishandles certificate changes."
