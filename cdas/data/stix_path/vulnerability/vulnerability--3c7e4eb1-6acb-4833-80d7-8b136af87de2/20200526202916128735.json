    "description": "Securifi Almond devices with firmware before AL1-R201EXP10-L304-W34 and Almond-2015 devices with firmware before AL2-R088M use a linear algorithm for selecting the ID value in the header of a DNS query performed on behalf of the device itself, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof responses by including this ID value, as demonstrated by a response containing the address of the firmware update server, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-2914."
