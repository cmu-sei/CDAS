An unauthenticated user can trigger a persistent XSS vulnerability found in the WAF log page (Control Center -> Log Viewer -> in the filter option \"\"Web Server Protection\"\") in the webadmin interface, and execute any action available to the webadmin of the firewall (e.g., creating a new user, enabling SSH, or adding an SSH authorized key). The WAF log page will execute the \"\"User-Agent\"\" parameter in the HTTP POST request."
