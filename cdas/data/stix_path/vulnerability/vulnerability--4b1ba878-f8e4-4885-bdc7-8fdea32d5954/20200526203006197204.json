    "description": "CF CLI version prior to v6.45.0 (bosh release version 1.16.0) writes the client id and secret to its config file when the user authenticates with --client-credentials flag. A local authenticated malicious user with access to the CF CLI config file can act as that client, who is the owner of the leaked credentials."
