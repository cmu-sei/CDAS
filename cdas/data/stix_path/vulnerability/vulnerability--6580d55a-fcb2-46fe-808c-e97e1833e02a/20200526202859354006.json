    "description": "The ff_h264_decode_seq_parameter_set function in h264_ps.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 1.1.3 does not validate the relationship between luma depth and chroma depth, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted H.264 data."
