    "description": "SAP Landscape Management, version 3.0, and SAP Adaptive Extensions, version 1.0, allows an attacker with admin_group privileges to change ownership and permissions (including S-user ID bit s-bit) of arbitrary files remotely. This results in the possibility to execute these files as root user from a non-root context, leading to Privilege Escalation."
