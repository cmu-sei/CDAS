    "description": "The Admin web application in Kinetica 7.0.9.2.20191118151947 does not properly sanitise the input for the function getLogs. This lack of sanitisation could be exploited to allow an authenticated attacker to run remote code on the underlying operating system. The logFile parameter in the getLogs function was used as a variable in a command to read log files; however, due to poor input sanitisation, it was possible to bypass a replacement and break out of the command."
