    "description": "An issue has been discovered on the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon Security Appliance before 03.2.00. Design flaws in OPC classic and in custom netfilter modules allow an attacker to remotely activate rules on the firewall and to connect to any TCP port of a protected asset, thus bypassing the firewall. The attack methodology is a crafted OPC dynamic port shift."
