    "description": "Users can lock their notes with a password in Memono version 3.8. Thus, users needs to know a password to read notes. However, these notes are stored in a database without encryption and an attacker can read the password-protected notes without having the password. Notes are stored in the ZENTITY table in the memono.sqlite database."
