    "description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a script file called \"\"get_file.sh\"\" which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the \"\"cmh-ext\"\" folder on the device. However, the \"\"filename\"\" parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder \"\"cmh-ext\"\" on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack."
