    "description": "An issue was discovered in the ajax-bootmodal-login plugin 1.4.3 for WordPress. The register form, login form, and password-recovery form require solving a CAPTCHA to perform actions. However, this is required only once per user session, and therefore one could send as many requests as one wished by automation."
