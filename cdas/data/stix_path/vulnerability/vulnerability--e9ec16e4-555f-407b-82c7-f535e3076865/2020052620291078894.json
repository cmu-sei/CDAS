    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Applications DBA component in Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.2, 12.2.3, and 12.2.4 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to DB Privileges.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on the researcher's claim that the PUBLIC role is granted the INDEX privilege for the DUAL table during a \"\"seeded install,\"\" which allows remote authenticated users to gain SYSDBA privileges and execute arbitrary code."
