    "description": "TheHive Project UnshortenLink analyzer before 1.1, included in Cortex-Analyzers before 1.15.2, has SSRF. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must create a new analysis, select URL for Data Type, and provide an SSRF payload like \"\"http://127.0.0.1:22\"\" in the Data parameter. The result can be seen in the main dashboard. Thus, it is possible to do port scans on localhost and intranet hosts."
