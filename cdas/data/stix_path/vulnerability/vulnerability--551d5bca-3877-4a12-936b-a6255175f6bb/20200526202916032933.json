    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.4 improperly follow the CORS cross-origin request algorithm for the POST method in situations involving an unspecified Content-Type header manipulation, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy by leveraging the lack of a preflight-request step."
