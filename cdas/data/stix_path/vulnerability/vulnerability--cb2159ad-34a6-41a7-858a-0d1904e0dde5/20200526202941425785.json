    "description": "The 'Upload logo from external path' function of SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor version 12.0.15300.90 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (permanent display of a \"\"Cannot exit above the top directory\"\" error message throughout the entire web application) via a \"\"..\"\" in the path field. In other words, the denial of service is caused by an incorrect implementation of a directory-traversal protection mechanism."
