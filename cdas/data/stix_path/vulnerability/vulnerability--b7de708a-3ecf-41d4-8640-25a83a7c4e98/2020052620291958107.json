    "description": "D-Link DSL-2740E 1.00_BG_20150720 devices are prone to persistent XSS attacks in the username and password fields: a remote unauthenticated user may craft logins and passwords with script tags in them. Because there is no sanitization in the input fields, an unaware logged-in administrator may be a victim when checking the router logs."
