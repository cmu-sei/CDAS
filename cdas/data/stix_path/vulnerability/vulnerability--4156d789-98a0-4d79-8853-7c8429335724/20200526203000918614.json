    "description": "An issue was discovered on NETGEAR Nighthawk M1 (MR1100) devices before 12.06.03. The web-interface Cross-Site Request Forgery token is stored in a dynamically generated JavaScript file, and therefore can be embedded in third party pages, and re-used against the Nighthawk web interface. This entirely bypasses the intended security benefits of the use of a CSRF-protection token."
