    "description": "In Symantec Endpoint Encryption before SEE 11.1.3HF3, a kernel memory leak is a type of resource leak that can occur when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. In object-oriented programming, a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code."
