    "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.7 and 4.7.8 allows any unprivileged Linux user to escalate privileges to root. The installer sets too relaxed permissions on /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/* core program files. By injecting a payload into one of those files, it will run with the same privileges as the Wowza server, root. For example, /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/tune.sh could be replaced with a Trojan horse."
