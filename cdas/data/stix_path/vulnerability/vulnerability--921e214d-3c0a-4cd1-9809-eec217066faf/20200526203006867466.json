    "description": "An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service &#8216;I/O-Check&#8217; function of the WAGO PFC 200 Firmware version 03.02.02(14). A specially crafted XML cache file written to a specific location on the device can be used to inject OS commands. An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file. At 0x1e900 the extracted gateway value from the xml file is used as an argument to /etc/config-tools/config_default_gateway number=0 state=enabled value=<contents of gateway node> using sprintf(). This command is later executed via a call to system()."
