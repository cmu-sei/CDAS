    "name": "CVE-2017-1000373",
    "description": "The OpenBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions."
