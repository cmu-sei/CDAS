    "description": "An issue was discovered in the HttpFoundation component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11. The PDOSessionHandler class allows storing sessions on a PDO connection. Under some configurations and with a well-crafted payload, it was possible to do a denial of service on a Symfony application without too much resources."
