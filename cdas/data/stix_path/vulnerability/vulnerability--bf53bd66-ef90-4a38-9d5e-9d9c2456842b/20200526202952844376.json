    "description": "An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the camera \"\"create\"\" feature of video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly extracts the \"\"state\"\" field from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability."
