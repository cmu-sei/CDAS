    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect integrity via vectors related to JMX.  NOTE: the previous information is from the June 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is due to an incorrect implementation of \"\"certain class checks\"\" that allows remote attackers to bypass intended class restrictions."
