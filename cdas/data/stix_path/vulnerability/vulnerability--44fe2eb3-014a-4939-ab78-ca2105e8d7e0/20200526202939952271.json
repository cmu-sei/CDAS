    "description": "EMC Data Protection Advisor 6.3.x before patch 67 and 6.4.x before patch 130 contains undocumented accounts with hard-coded passwords and various privileges. Affected accounts are: \"\"Apollo System Test\"\", \"\"emc.dpa.agent.logon\"\" and \"\"emc.dpa.metrics.logon\"\". An attacker with knowledge of the password could potentially use these accounts via REST APIs to gain unauthorized access to EMC Data Protection Advisor (including potentially access with administrative privileges)."
