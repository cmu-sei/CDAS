    "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability in Juniper Networks QFX10K Series, EX9200 Series, MX Series, and PTX Series with Next-Generation Routing Engine (NG-RE), allows a local authenticated high privileged user to access the underlying WRL host. This issue only affects QFX10K Series with NG-RE, EX9200 Series with NG-RE, MX Series with NG-RE and PTX Series with NG-RE; which uses vmhost. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S6; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S11; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S11, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S9, 17.2R3-S3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S5, 17.3R3-S7; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S7, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S4; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D50; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2. To identify whether the device has NG-RE with vmhost, customer can run the following command: > show vmhost status Compute cluster: rainier-re-cc Compute Node: rainier-re-cn, Online If the \"\"show vmhost status\"\" is not supported, then the device does not have NG-RE with vmhost."
