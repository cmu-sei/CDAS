    "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Finesse Notification Service for Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) 11.5(1) and 11.6(1) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve information from agents using the Finesse Desktop. The vulnerability is due to the existence of a user account that has an undocumented, hard-coded password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the hard-coded credentials to subscribe to the Finesse Notification Service, which would allow the attacker to receive notifications when an agent signs in or out of the Finesse Desktop, when information about an agent changes, or when an agent's state changes. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc08314."
