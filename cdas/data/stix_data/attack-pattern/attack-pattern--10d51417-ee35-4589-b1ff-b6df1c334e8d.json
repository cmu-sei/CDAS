There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1028) can also be used externally.\n\nAdversaries may use remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. (Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network. Access to remote services may be used as part of [Redundant Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1108) during an operation.",
