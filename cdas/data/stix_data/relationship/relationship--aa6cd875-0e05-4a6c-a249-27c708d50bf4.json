Configure user permissions, groups, and roles for access to cloud-based systems as well. Implement strict IAM controls to prevent access to systems except for the applications, users, and services that require access. Consider using temporary credentials that are only good for a certain period of time in cloud environments to reduce the effectiveness of compromised accounts.",
