    "description": "An exploitable stack buffer overflow vulnerability vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service &#8216;I/O-Check&#8217; functionality of WAGO PFC 200 Firmware version 03.02.02(14). An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file. The destination buffer sp+0x440 is overflowed with the call to sprintf() for any ip values that are greater than 1024-len(&#8216;/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=enabled ip-address=&#8216;) in length. A ip value of length 0x3da will cause the service to crash."
