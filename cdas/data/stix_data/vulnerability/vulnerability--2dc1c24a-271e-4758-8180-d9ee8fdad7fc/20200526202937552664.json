    "description": "In version 3.5 and prior of Cambium Networks ePMP firmware, a lack of input sanitation for certain parameters on the web management console allows any authenticated user (including the otherwise low-privilege readonly user) to inject shell meta-characters as part of a specially-crafted POST request to the get_chart function and run OS-level commands, effectively as root."
