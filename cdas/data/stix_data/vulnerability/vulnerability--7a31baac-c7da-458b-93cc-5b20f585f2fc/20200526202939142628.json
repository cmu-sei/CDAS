    "name": "CVE-2017-7272",
    "description": "PHP through 7.1.11 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen or pfsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second argument of the function."
