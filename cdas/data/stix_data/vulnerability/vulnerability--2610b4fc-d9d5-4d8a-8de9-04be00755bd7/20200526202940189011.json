    "description": "In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, variable \"\"dbg_buf\"\", \"\"dbg_buf->curr\"\" and \"\"dbg_buf->filled_size\"\" could be modified by different threads at the same time, but they are not protected with mutex or locks. Buffer overflow is possible on race conditions. \"\"buffer->curr\"\" itself could also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel memory (for write)."
