    "description": "On BIG-IP 14.0.0-14.0.0.2, 13.0.0-13.1.0.7, 12.1.0-12.1.3.5, 11.6.0-11.6.3.2, or 11.2.1-11.5.6, BIG-IQ Centralized Management 6.0.0-6.0.1, 5.0.0-5.4.0 or 4.6.0, BIG-IQ Cloud and Orchestration 1.0.0, iWorkflow 2.0.1-2.3.0, or Enterprise Manager 3.1.1 a BIG-IP user granted with tmsh access may cause the BIG-IP system to experience denial-of-service (DoS) when the BIG-IP user uses the tmsh utility to run the edit cli preference command and proceeds to save the changes to another filename repeatedly. This action utilises storage space on the /var partition and when performed repeatedly causes the /var partition to be full."
