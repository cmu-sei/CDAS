    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The WEBrick gem 1.4.2 for Ruby allows directory traversal if the attacker once had local access to create a symlink to a location outside of the web root directory. NOTE: The vendor states that this is analogous to Options FollowSymlinks in the Apache HTTP Server, and therefore it is \"\"not a problem."
