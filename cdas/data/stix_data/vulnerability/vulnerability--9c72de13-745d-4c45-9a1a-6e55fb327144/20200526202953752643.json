    "description": "Bouncy Castle BKS version 1 keystore (BKS-V1) files use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS-V1 keystore. All BKS-V1 keystores are vulnerable. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 introduces BKS version 2, which uses a 160-bit MAC."
