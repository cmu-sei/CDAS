    "description": "The internal DNS server in Samba 4.x before 4.0.18 does not check the QR field in the header section of an incoming DNS message before sending a response, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) via a forged response packet that triggers a communication loop, a related issue to CVE-1999-0103."
