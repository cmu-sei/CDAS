    "description": "A vulnerability in the logging configuration of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) policies for Cisco FirePOWER System Software 5.3.0 through 6.2.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high consumption of system resources. The vulnerability is due to the logging of certain TCP packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition. The success of an exploit is dependent on how an administrator has configured logging for SSL policies for a device. This vulnerability affects Cisco FirePOWER System Software that is configured to log connections by using SSL policy default actions. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd07072."
