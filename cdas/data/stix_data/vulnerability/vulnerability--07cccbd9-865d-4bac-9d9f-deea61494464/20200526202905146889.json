    "description": "The assoc_array_gc function in the associative-array implementation in lib/assoc_array.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16.3 does not properly implement garbage collection, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via multiple \"\"keyctl newring\"\" operations followed by a \"\"keyctl timeout\"\" operation."
