    "description": "An issue was discovered in sd-bus in systemd 239. bus_process_object() in libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c allocates a variable-length stack buffer for temporarily storing the object path of incoming D-Bus messages. An unprivileged local user can exploit this by sending a specially crafted message to PID1, causing the stack pointer to jump over the stack guard pages into an unmapped memory region and trigger a denial of service (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic)."
