    "description": "The extension APIs in the kernel in Apple iOS before 8.1.3, Apple OS X before 10.10.2, and Apple TV before 7.0.3 do not prevent the presence of addresses within an OSBundleMachOHeaders key in a response, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted app."
