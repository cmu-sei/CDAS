    "description": "The MS-SAMR and MS-LSAD protocol implementations in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.11, 4.3.x before 4.3.8, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 mishandle DCERPC connections, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to perform protocol-downgrade attacks and impersonate users by modifying the client-server data stream, aka \"\"BADLOCK."
