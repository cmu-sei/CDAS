    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in OZW672 (All versions < V10.00), OZW772 (All versions < V10.00). Vulnerable versions of OZW Web Server use predictable path names for project files that legitimately authenticated users have created by using the application's export function. By accessing a specific uniform resource locator on the web server, a remote attacker could be able to download a project file without prior authentication. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected system. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises the confidentiality of the targeted system."
