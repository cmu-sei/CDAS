    "description": "A vulnerability in the web framework code for Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router and Small Business RV Series RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a directory path traversal attack on a targeted device. The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location."
