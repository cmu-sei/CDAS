    "description": "Apache Cordova 3.3.0 and earlier and Adobe PhoneGap 2.9.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to bypass intended device-resource restrictions of an event-based bridge via a crafted library clone that leverages IFRAME script execution and waits a certain amount of time for an OnJsPrompt handler return value as an alternative to correct synchronization."
