    "description": "The ngx_http_parse_chunked function in http/ngx_http_parse.c in nginx 1.3.9 through 1.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via a chunked Transfer-Encoding request with a large chunk size, which triggers an integer signedness error and a stack-based buffer overflow."
