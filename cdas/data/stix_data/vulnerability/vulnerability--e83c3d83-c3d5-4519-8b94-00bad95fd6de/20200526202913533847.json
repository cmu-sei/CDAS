    "description": "The fragment_add_work function in epan/reassemble.c in the packet-reassembly feature in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not properly determine the defragmentation state in a case of an insufficient snapshot length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted packet."
