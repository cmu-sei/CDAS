    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The cr_tknzr_parse_rgb function in cr-tknzr.c in libcroco 0.6.11 and 0.6.12 has an \"\"outside the range of representable values of type long\"\" undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted CSS file. NOTE: third-party analysis reports \"\"This is not a security issue in my view. The conversion surely is truncating the double into a long value, but there is no impact as the value is one of the RGB components."
