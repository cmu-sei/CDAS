    "description": "IBM DataPower Gateway appliances with firmware 6.x before 6.0.0.17, 6.0.1.x before 6.0.1.17, 7.x before 7.0.0.10, 7.1.0.x before 7.1.0.7, and 7.2.x before 7.2.0.1 do not set the secure flag for unspecified cookies in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture these cookies by intercepting their transmission within an http session."
