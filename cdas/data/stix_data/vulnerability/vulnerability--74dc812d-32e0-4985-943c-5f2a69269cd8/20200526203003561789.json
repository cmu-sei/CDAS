    "description": "A vulnerability in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the lspv_server process to crash. The crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic though the device, resulting in a DoS condition that require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions."
