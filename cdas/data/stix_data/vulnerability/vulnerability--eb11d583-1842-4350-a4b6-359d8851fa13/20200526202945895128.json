    "description": "In Apache Fineract versions 1.0.0, 0.6.0-incubating, 0.5.0-incubating, 0.4.0-incubating, the system exposes different REST end points to query domain specific entities with a Query Parameter 'orderBy' and 'sortOrder' which are appended directly with SQL statements. A hacker/user can inject/draft the 'orderBy' and 'sortOrder' query parameter in such a way to read/update the data for which he doesn't have authorization."
