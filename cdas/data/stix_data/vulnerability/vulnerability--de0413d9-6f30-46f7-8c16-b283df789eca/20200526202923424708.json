    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 48.0 does not properly set the LINKABLE and URI_SAFE_FOR_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT flags of about: URLs that are used for error pages, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct spoofing attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by misleading text after an about:neterror?d= substring."
