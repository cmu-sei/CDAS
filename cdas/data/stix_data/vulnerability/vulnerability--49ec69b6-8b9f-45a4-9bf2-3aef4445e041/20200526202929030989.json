    "description": "In all Qualcomm products with Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, in audio_aio_ion_lookup_vaddr, the buffer length, which is user input, ends up being used to validate if the buffer is fully within the valid region. If the buffer length is large enough then the address + length operation could overflow and produce a result far below the valid region."
