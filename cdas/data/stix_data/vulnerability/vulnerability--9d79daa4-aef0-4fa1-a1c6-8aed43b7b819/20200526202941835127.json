    "description": "The get_build_id function in opncls.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted file in which a certain size field is larger than a corresponding data field, as demonstrated by mishandling within the objdump program."
