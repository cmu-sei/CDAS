    "description": "The h264_slice_header_init function in libavcodec/h264_slice.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.3 does not validate the relationship between the number of threads and the number of slices, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted H.264 data."
