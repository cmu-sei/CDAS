    "description": "electron-packager is a command line tool that packages Electron source code into `.app` and `.exe` packages. along with Electron. The `--strict-ssl` command line option in electron-packager >= 5.2.1 <= 6.0.0 || >=6.0.0 <= 6.0.2 defaults to false if not explicitly set to true. This could allow an attacker to perform a man in the middle attack."
