    "description": "MediaWiki before 1.19.6 and 1.20.x before 1.20.5 does not allow extensions to prevent password changes without using both Special:PasswordReset and Special:ChangePassword, which allows remote attackers to bypass the intended restrictions of an extension that only implements one of these blocks."
