    "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.292 and 14.x through 18.x before 18.0.0.160, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.144, Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.144, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.144 on 64-bit Windows 7 systems do not properly select a random memory address for the Flash heap, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct unspecified attacks by predicting this address."
