    "description": "The HTMLSourceElement::AfterSetAttr function in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0 does not properly constrain the original data type of a casted value during the setting of a SOURCE element's attributes, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted HTML document."
