    "description": "The Endpoint Manager for Remote Control component in IBM Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Lifecycle Management 9.0.1 before IF6 and 9.1.0 before IF6 does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session."
