    "description": "Conexant Systems mictray64 task, as used on HP Elite, EliteBook, ProBook, and ZBook systems, leaks sensitive data (keystrokes) to any process. In mictray64.exe (mic tray icon) 1.0.0.46, a LowLevelKeyboardProc Windows hook is used to capture keystrokes. This data is leaked via unintended channels: debug messages accessible to any process that is running in the current user session, and filesystem access to C:\\Users\\Public\\MicTray.log by any process."
