A remote, unauthenticated malicious user, with the knowledge of a target user's anti-CSRF token, could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim Security Console user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application, which code is then executed by the victim's web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application."
