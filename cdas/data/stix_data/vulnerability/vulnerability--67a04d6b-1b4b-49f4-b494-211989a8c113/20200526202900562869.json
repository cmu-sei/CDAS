    "description": "Xjp2.dll in XnView before 2.13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the Csiz parameter in a SIZ marker, which triggers an incorrect memory allocation, or (2) the lqcd field in a QCD marker in a crafted JPEG2000 file, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow."
