    "description": "The Sophos AV parsing engine before 2020-01-14 allows virus-detection bypass via a crafted ZIP archive. This affects Endpoint Protection, Cloud Optix, Mobile, Intercept X Endpoint, Intercept X for Server, and Secure Web Gateway. NOTE: the vendor feels that this does not apply to endpoint-protection products because the virus would be detected upon extraction."
