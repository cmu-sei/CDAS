    "description": "The RAKP protocol support in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) implementation in Integrated Management Module (IMM) and Integrated Management Module II (IMM2) on IBM BladeCenter, Flex System, System x iDataPlex, and System x3### servers sends a password hash to the client, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack."
