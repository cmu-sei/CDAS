    "description": "The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories of \"\"/private/var\"\" that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to \"\"/private/var\"\" and its subdirectories. Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 52 and Thunderbird < 52."
