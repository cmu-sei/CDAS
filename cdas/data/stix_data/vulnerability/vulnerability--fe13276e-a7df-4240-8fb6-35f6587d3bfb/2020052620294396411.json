    "description": "There is a stack-based buffer over-read in calling GLib in the function gxps_images_guess_content_type of gxps-images.c in libgxps through 0.3.0 because it does not reject negative return values from a g_input_stream_read call. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of service attack."
