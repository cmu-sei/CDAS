    "description": "The function hso_get_config_data in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.8 reads if_num from the USB device (as a u8) and uses it to index a small array, resulting in an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read that potentially allows arbitrary read in the kernel address space."
