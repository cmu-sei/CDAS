    "name": "CVE-2017-11410",
    "description": "In Wireshark through 2.0.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.7, the WBXML dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding validation of the relationships between indexes and lengths. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7702."
