    "description": "The content security policy (CSP) \"\"sandbox\"\" directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the \"\"allow-same-origin\"\" keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4."
