    "description": "Huawei S7700, S9300, S9700, and S12700 devices with software before V200R008C00SPC500 use random numbers with insufficient entropy to generate self-signed certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover private keys by leveraging knowledge of a certificate."
