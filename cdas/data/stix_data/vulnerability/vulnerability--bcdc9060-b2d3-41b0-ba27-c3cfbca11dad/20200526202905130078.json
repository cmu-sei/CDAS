    "description": "The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by putting the VM into the rescue state, suspending it, which puts into an ERROR state, and then deleting the image.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2573."
