    "description": "A vulnerability in the ImageID parameter of Cisco Unity Connection 10.5(2) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem of an affected device. The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP POST parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd90118."
