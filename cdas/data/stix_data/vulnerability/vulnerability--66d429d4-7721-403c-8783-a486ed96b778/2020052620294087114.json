    "description": "ArubaOS, all versions prior to 6.3.1.25, 6.4 prior to 6.4.4.16, 6.5.x prior to 6.5.1.9, 6.5.2, 6.5.3 prior to 6.5.3.3, 6.5.4 prior to 6.5.4.2, 8.x prior to 8.1.0.4 FIPS and non-FIPS versions of software are both affected equally is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file access. An unauthenticated user with network access to an Aruba mobility controller on TCP port 8080 or 8081 may be able to access arbitrary files stored on the mobility controller. Ports 8080 and 8081 are used for captive portal functionality and are listening, by default, on all IP interfaces of the mobility controller, including captive portal interfaces. The attacker could access files which could contain passwords, keys, and other sensitive information that could lead to full system compromise."
