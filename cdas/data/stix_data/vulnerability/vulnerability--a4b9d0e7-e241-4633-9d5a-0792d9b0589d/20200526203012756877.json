    "description": "A vulnerability in DNS over IPv6 packet processing for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper length validation of a field in an IPv6 DNS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS query over IPv6, which traverses the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to DNS over IPv6 traffic only."
