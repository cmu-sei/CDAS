    "description": "net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc in the TLS implementation in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.48 does not ensure that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before renegotiation, which might allow remote web servers to interfere with trust relationships by renegotiating a session."
