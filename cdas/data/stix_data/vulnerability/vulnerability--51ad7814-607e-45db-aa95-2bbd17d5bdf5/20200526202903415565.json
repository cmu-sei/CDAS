    "description": "Secure Transport in Apple iOS before 7.1.1, Apple OS X 10.8.x and 10.9.x through 10.9.2, and Apple TV before 6.1.1 does not ensure that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before renegotiation, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information or modify TLS session data via a \"\"triple handshake attack."
