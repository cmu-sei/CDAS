    "description": "The XSSAuditor::init function in core/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp in the XSS auditor in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117, processes POST requests by using the body of a redirecting page instead of the body of a redirect target, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors."
