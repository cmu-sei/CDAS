    "description": "CentOS-WebPanel.com (aka CWP) CentOS Web Panel 0.9.8.864 allows an attacker to get a victim's session file name from /home/[USERNAME]/tmp/session/sess_xxxxxx, and the victim's token value from /usr/local/cwpsrv/logs/access_log, then use them to gain access to the victim's password (for the OS and phpMyAdmin) via an attacker account. This is different from CVE-2019-14782."
