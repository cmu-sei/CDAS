    "description": "The nsCSPHostSrc::permits function in dom/security/nsCSPUtils.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 40.0 does not implement the Content Security Policy Level 2 exceptions for the blob, data, and filesystem URL schemes during wildcard source-expression matching, which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging unexpected policy-enforcement behavior."
