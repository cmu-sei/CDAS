    "description": "** DISPUTED ** admin/app/mediamanager in Schlix CMS 2.1.8-7 allows Authenticated Unrestricted File Upload, leading to remote code execution. NOTE: \"\"While inadvertently allowing a PHP file to be uploaded via Media Manager was an oversight, it still requires an admin permission. We think it's pretty rare for an administrator to exploit a bug on his/her own site to own his/her own site."
