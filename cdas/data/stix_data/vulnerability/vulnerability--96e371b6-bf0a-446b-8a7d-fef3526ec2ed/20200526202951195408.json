    "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the fileDownload function in the CommonController class in FEBS-Shiro before 2018-11-05. An attacker can download a file via a request of the form /common/download?filename=1.jsp&delete=false. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes the significance of this report because the product uses a JAR archive for deployment, and this contains application.yml with configuration data."
