    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66."
