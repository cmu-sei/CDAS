    "description": "The dissect_r3_upstreamcommand_queryconfig function in epan/dissectors/packet-assa_r3.c in the Assa Abloy R3 dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.8 does not properly handle a zero-length item, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop, and CPU and memory consumption) via a crafted packet."
