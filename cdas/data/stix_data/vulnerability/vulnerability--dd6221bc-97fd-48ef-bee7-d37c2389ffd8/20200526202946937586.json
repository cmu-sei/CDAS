    "description": "TeamViewer through 13.1.1548 stores a password in Unicode format within TeamViewer.exe process memory between \"\"[00 88] and \"\"[00 00 00]\"\" delimiters, which might make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging an unattended workstation on which TeamViewer has disconnected but remains running."
