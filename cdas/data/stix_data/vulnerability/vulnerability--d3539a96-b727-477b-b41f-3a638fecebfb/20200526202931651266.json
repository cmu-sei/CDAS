    "description": "D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02) devices use the same hardcoded /etc/stunnel.key private key across different customers' installations, which allows remote attackers to defeat the HTTPS cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation."
