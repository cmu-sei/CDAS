    "description": "Atlassian JIRA Software 7.0.3, JIRA Core 7.0.3, and the bundled JIRA Service Desk 3.0.3 installer attaches the wrong image to e-mail notifications when a user views an issue with inline wiki markup referencing an image attachment, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by updating a different issue that includes wiki markup for an external image reference."
