    "description": "Stored XSS within Quadbase EspressReport ES (ERES) v7.0 update 7 allows remote attackers to execute malicious JavaScript and inject arbitrary source code into the target pages. The XSS payload is stored by creating a new user account, and setting the username to an XSS payload. The stored payload can then be triggered by accessing the \"\"Set Security Levels\"\" or \"\"View User/Group Relationships\"\" page. If the attacker does not currently have permission to create a new user, another vulnerability such as CSRF must be exploited first."
