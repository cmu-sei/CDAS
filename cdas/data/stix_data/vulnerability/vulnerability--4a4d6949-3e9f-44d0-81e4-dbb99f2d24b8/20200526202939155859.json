    "description": "An issue was discovered in Unitrends Enterprise Backup before 9.1.2. A lack of sanitization of user input in the createReportName and saveReport functions in recoveryconsole/bpl/reports.php allows for an authenticated user to create a randomly named file on disk with a user-controlled extension, contents, and path, leading to remote code execution, aka Unrestricted File Upload."
