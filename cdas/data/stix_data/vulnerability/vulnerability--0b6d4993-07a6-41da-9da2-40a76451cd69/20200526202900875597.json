    "description": "The rwm overlay in OpenLDAP 2.4.23, 2.4.36, and earlier does not properly count references, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (slapd crash) by unbinding immediately after a search request, which triggers rwm_conn_destroy to free the session context while it is being used by rwm_op_search."
