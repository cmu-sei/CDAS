    "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of a CLI diagnostic command in Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive system files that should be restricted. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to incomplete role-based access control (RBAC) verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a specific CLI diagnostic command with crafted user-input parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform an arbitrary read of a file on the device, and the file may contain sensitive information. The attacker needs valid device credentials to exploit this vulnerability."
