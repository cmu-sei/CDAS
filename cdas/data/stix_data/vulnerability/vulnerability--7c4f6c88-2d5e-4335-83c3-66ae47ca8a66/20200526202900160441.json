    "description": "EMC RSA Authentication Agent for PAM 7.0 before 7.0.2.1 enforces the maximum number of login attempts within the PAM-enabled application codebase, instead of within the Agent codebase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover correct login credentials via a brute-force attack."
