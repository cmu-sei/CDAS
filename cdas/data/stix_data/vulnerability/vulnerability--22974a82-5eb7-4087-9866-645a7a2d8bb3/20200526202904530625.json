    "description": "The getObjectByToken function in Newsletter.php in the Pimcore_Tool_Newsletter module in pimcore 1.4.9 through 2.0.0 does not properly handle an object obtained by unserializing Lucene search data, which allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks and execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy object and a pathname with a trailing \\0 character."
