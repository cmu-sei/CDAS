    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle iSupplier Portal component in Oracle E-Business Suite 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, and 12.2.4 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to XML input.  NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a crafted DTD in an XML request to OA_HTML/oramipp_lpr."
