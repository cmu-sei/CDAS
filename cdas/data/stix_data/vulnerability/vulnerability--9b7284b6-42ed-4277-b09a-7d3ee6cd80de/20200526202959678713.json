    "name": "CVE-2019-12795",
    "description": "daemon/gvfsdaemon.c in gvfsd from GNOME gvfs before 1.38.3, 1.40.x before 1.40.2, and 1.41.x before 1.41.3 opened a private D-Bus server socket without configuring an authorization rule. A local attacker could connect to this server socket and issue D-Bus method calls. (Note that the server socket only accepts a single connection, so the attacker would have to discover the server and connect to the socket before its owner does.)"
