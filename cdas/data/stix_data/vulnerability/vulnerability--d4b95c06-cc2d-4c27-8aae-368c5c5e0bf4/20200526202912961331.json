    "description": "Juniper Junos 12.1X44 before 12.1X44-D45, 12.1X46 before 12.1X46-D30, 12.1X47 before 12.1X47-D15, and 12.3X48 before 12.3X48-D10 on SRX series devices does not properly enforce the log-out-on-disconnect feature when configured in the [system port console] stanza, which allows physically proximate attackers to reconnect to the console port and gain administrative access by leveraging access to the device."
