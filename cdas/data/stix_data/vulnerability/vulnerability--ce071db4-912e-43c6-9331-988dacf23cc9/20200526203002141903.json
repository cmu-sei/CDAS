    "description": "A vulnerability in the vManage web-based UI (web UI) of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected instance of vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user."
