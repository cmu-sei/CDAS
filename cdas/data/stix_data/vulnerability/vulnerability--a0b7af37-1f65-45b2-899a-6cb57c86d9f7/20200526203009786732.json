The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly."
