    "description": "When an Apache Geode server versions 1.0.0 to 1.4.0 is configured with a security manager, a user with DATA:WRITE privileges is allowed to deploy code by invoking an internal Geode function. This allows remote code execution. Code deployment should be restricted to users with DATA:MANAGE privilege."
