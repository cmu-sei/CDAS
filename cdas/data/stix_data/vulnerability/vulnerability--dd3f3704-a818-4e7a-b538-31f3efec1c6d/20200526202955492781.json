    "description": "HWiNFO AMD64 Kernel driver version 8.98 and lower allows an unprivileged user to send an IOCTL to the device driver. If input and/or output buffer pointers are NULL or if these buffers' data are invalid, a NULL/invalid pointer access occurs, resulting in a Windows kernel panic aka Blue Screen. This affects IOCTLs higher than 0x85FE2600 with the HWiNFO32 symbolic device name."
