    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PhantomPDF 9.7.0.29478. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the DuplicatePages command of the communication API. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition.
