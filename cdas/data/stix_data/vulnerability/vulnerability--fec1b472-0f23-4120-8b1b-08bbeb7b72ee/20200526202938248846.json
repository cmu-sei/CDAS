    "description": "When the F5 BIG-IP 12.1.0-12.1.1, 11.6.0-11.6.1, 11.5.1-11.5.5, or 11.2.1 system is configured with a wildcard IPSec tunnel endpoint, it may allow a remote attacker to disrupt or impersonate the tunnels that have completed phase 1 IPSec negotiations. The attacker must possess the necessary credentials to negotiate the phase 1 of the IPSec exchange to exploit this vulnerability; in many environment this limits the attack surface to other endpoints under the same administration."
