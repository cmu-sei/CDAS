    "name": "CVE-2017-15855",
    "description": "In Qualcomm Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, and QRD Android with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel before security patch level 2018-04-05, the camera application triggers \"\"user-memory-access\"\" issue as the Camera CPP module Linux driver directly accesses the application provided buffer, which resides in user space. An unchecked userspace value (ioctl_ptr->len) is used to copy contents to a kernel buffer which can lead to kernel buffer overflow."
