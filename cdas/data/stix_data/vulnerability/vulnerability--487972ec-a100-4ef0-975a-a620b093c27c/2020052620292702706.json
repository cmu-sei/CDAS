    "description": "An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. There is a path traversal issue in the Apport crash file \"\"Package\"\" and \"\"SourcePackage\"\" fields. These fields are used to build a path to the package specific hook files in the /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory. An attacker can exploit this path traversal to execute arbitrary Python files from the local system."
