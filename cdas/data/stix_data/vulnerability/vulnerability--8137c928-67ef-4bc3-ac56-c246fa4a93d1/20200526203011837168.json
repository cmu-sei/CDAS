    "description": "Due to insufficient server-side login attempt limit enforcement, a vulnerability in the SSH login service of Juniper Networks Juniper Advanced Threat Prevention (JATP) Series and Virtual JATP (vJATP) devices allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform multiple login attempts in excess of the configured login attempt limit. Successful exploitation will allow the attacker to perform brute-force password attacks on the SSH service. This issue affects: Juniper Networks JATP and vJATP versions prior to 5.0.6.0."
