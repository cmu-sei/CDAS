    "description": "Google Chrome before 25.0.1364.97 on Windows and Linux, and before 25.0.1364.99 on Mac OS X, does not properly enforce a user gesture requirement before proceeding with a file download, which might make it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file."
