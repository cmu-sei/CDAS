    "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. URN response handling in Squid suffers from a heap-based buffer overflow. When receiving data from a remote server in response to an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit within the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data overflowing in the heap."
