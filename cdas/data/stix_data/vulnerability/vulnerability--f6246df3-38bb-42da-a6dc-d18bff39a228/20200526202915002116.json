    "description": "The (1) mdare64_48.sys, (2) mdare32_48.sys, (3) mdare32_52.sys, (4) mdare64_52.sys, and (5) Fortishield.sys drivers in Fortinet FortiClient before 5.2.4 do not properly restrict access to the API for management of processes and the Windows registry, which allows local users to obtain a privileged handle to a PID and possibly have unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by a 0x2220c8 ioctl call."
