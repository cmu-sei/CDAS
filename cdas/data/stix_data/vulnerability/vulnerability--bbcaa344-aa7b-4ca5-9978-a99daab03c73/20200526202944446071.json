    "description": "An issue was discovered on SoftCase T-Router build 20112017 devices. There are no restrictions on the 'exec command' feature of the T-Router protocol. If the command syntax is correct, there is code execution both on the other modem and on the main servers. This is fixed in production builds as of Spring 2018."
