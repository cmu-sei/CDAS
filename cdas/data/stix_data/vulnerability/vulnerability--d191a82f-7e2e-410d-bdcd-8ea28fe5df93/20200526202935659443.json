    "description": "Puppet Enterprise versions prior to 2016.4.5 and 2017.2.1 did not correctly authenticate users before returning labeled RBAC access tokens. This issue has been fixed in Puppet Enterprise 2016.4.5 and 2017.2.1. This only affects users with labeled tokens, which is not the default for tokens."
