    "name": "CVE-2017-17522",
    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software maintainer indicates that exploitation is impossible because the code relies on subprocess.Popen and the default shell=False setting."
