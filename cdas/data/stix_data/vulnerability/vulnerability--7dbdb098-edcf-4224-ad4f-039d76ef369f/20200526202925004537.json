    "description": "The php_wddx_process_data function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid ISO 8601 time value, as demonstrated by a wddx_deserialize call that mishandles a dateTime element in a wddxPacket XML document."
