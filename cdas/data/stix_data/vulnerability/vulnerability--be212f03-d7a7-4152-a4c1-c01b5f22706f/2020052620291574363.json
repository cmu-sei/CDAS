    "description": "The ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore function in core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.71, proceeds with a DOM tree insertion in certain cases where a parent node no longer contains a child node, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code."
