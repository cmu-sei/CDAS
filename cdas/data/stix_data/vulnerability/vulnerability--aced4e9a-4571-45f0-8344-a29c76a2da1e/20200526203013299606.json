    "description": "Android App 'MyPallete' and some of the Android banking applications based on 'MyPallete' do not verify X.509 certificates from servers, and also do not properly validate certificates with host-mismatch, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate."
