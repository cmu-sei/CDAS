    "description": "An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the credentials handler of video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250-Firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. The strncpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 2,000 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"\"sessionToken\"\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability."
