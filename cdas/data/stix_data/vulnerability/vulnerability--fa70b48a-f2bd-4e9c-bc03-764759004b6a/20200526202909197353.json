    "description": "ConfBridge in Asterisk 11.x before 11.14.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.6 before 11.6-cert8 does not properly handle state changes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (channel hang and memory consumption) by causing transitions to be delayed, which triggers a state change from hung up to waiting for media."
