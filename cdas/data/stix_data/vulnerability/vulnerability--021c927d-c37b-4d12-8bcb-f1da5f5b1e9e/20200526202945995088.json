    "description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive memory allocation and application crash) via a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by _bfd_elf_parse_attributes in elf-attrs.c and bfd_malloc in libbfd.c. This can occur during execution of nm."
