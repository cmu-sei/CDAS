    "description": "Huawei Mobile WiFi E5151 routers with software before E5151s-2TCPU-V200R001B146D27SP00C00 and E5186 routers with software before V200R001B310D01SP00C00 allow DNS query packets using the static source port, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof responses via unspecified vectors."
