    "description": "The D-Link NPAPI extension, as used on D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02) devices, does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate."
