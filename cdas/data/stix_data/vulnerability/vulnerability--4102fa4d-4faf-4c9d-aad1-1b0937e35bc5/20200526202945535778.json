    "description": "The CorsairService Service in Corsair Utility Engine is installed with insecure default permissions, which allows unprivileged local users to execute arbitrary commands via modification of the CorsairService BINARY_PATH_NAME, leading to complete control of the affected system. The issue exists due to the Windows \"\"Everyone\"\" group being granted SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permissions to the CorsairService Service."
