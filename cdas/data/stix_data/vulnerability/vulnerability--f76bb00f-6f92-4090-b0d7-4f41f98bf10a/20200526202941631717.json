    "description": "The process_otr function in bfd/versados.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, does not validate a certain offset, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during \"\"objdump -D\"\" execution."
