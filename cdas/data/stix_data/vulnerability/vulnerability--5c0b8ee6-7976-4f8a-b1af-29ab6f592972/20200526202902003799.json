    "description": "The genlock_dev_ioctl function in genlock.c in the Genlock driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a crafted GENLOCK_IOC_EXPORT ioctl call."
