    "description": "Siemens Scalance W7xx devices with firmware before 4.5.4 use the same hardcoded X.509 certificate across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship."
