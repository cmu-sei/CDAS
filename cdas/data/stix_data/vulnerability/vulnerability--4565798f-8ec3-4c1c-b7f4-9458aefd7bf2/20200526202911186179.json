    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 36.0 does not properly recognize the equivalence of domain names with and without a trailing . (dot) character, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the HPKP and HSTS protection mechanisms by constructing a URL with this character and leveraging access to an X.509 certificate for a domain with this character."
