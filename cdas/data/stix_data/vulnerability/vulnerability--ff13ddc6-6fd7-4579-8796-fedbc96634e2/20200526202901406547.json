    "description": "The NTP implementation in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.1, and IOS XE 2.1 through 3.3, does not properly handle encapsulation of multicast NTP packets within MSDP SA messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) by leveraging an MSDP peer relationship, aka Bug ID CSCuc81226."
