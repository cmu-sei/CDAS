    "description": "MEDHOST Document Management System contains hard-coded credentials that are used for customer database access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate directly with the database may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial information. PostgreSQL is used as the Document Management System database. The account name is dms. The password is hard-coded throughout the application, and is the same across all installations. Customers do not have the option to change passwords. The dms account for PostgreSQL has access to the database schema for Document Management System."
