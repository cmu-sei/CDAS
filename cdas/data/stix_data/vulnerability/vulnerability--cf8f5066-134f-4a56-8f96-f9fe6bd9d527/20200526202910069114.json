    "description": "common.c in infosvr in ASUS WRT firmware 3.0.0.4.376_1071, 3.0.0.376.2524-g0013f52, and other versions, as used in RT-AC66U, RT-N66U, and other routers, does not properly check the MAC address for a request, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands via a NET_CMD_ID_MANU_CMD packet to UDP port 9999.  NOTE: this issue was incorrectly mapped to CVE-2014-10000, but that ID is invalid due to its use as an example of the 2014 CVE ID syntax change."
