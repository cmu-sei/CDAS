    "description": "Mozilla Firefox through 27 sends HTTP Cookie headers without first validating that they have the required character-set restrictions, which allows remote attackers to conduct the equivalent of a persistent Logout CSRF attack via a crafted parameter that forces a web application to set a malformed cookie within an HTTP response."
