    "description": "net/ipv6/ip6_output.c in the Linux kernel through 3.11.4 does not properly determine the need for UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing of small packets after the UFO queueing of a large packet, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via network traffic that triggers a large response packet."
