    "description": "A vulnerability in access control list (ACL) functionality of the Gigabit Ethernet Management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reach the configured IP addresses on the Gigabit Ethernet Management interface. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that was introduced in the Cisco IOS XE Software 16.1.1 Release, which prevents the ACL from working when applied against the management interface. An attacker could exploit this issue by attempting to access the device via the management interface."
