    "description": "The batadv_frag_merge_packets function in net/batman-adv/fragmentation.c in the B.A.T.M.A.N. implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 uses an incorrect length field during a calculation of an amount of memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented packets."
