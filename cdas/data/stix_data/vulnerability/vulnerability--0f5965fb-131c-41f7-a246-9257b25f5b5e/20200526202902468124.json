    "name": "CVE-2013-7313",
    "description": "The OSPF implementation in Juniper Junos through 13.x, JunosE, and ScreenOS through 6.3.x does not consider the possibility of duplicate Link State ID values in Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets before performing operations on the LSA database, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (routing disruption) or obtain sensitive packet information via a crafted LSA packet, a related issue to CVE-2013-0149."
