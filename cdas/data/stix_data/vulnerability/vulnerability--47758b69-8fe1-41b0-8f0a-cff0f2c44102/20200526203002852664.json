    "description": "A stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server through 4.2.0-b2047 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via /WiKIDAdmin/userPreregistration.jsp. The preRegistrationData parameter is vulnerable: a reflected cross-site scripting occurs immediately after a .csv file is uploaded. The malicious script is stored and can be executed again when the List Pre-Registration functionality is used."
