    "description": "A vulnerability in the IP Version 4 (IPv4) processing code of Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 3850 and Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IPv4 packets to an IPv4 address on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of the affected device that leads to a DoS condition. If the switch does not reboot when under attack, it would require manual intervention to reload the device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 3850 and Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches that are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.1.1 or later, until the first fixed release, and are configured with an IPv4 address. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd80714."
