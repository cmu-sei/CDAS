    "description": "The SSLClientSocketNSS::Core::OwnAuthCertHandler function in net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117 does not prevent changes to server X.509 certificates during renegotiations, which allows remote SSL servers to trigger use of a new certificate chain, inconsistent with the user's expectations, by initiating a TLS renegotiation."
