    "description": "The \"\"create an instance\"\" API in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana does not properly enforce the os-flavor-access:is_public property, which allows remote authenticated users to boot arbitrary flavors by guessing the flavor id.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2256."
