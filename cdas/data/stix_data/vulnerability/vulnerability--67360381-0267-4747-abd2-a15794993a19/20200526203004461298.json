    "name": "CVE-2019-19920",
    "description": "sa-exim 4.2.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code if they can write a .cf file or a rule. This occurs because Greylisting.pm relies on eval (rather than direct parsing and/or use of the taint feature). This issue is similar to CVE-2018-11805."
