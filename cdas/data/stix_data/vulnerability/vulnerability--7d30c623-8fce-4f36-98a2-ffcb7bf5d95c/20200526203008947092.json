    "description": "DedeCMS through V5.7SP2 allows arbitrary file upload in dede/album_edit.php or dede/album_add.php, as demonstrated by a dede/album_edit.php?dopost=save&formzip=1 request with a ZIP archive that contains a file such as \"\"1.jpg.php\"\" (because input validation only checks that .jpg, .png, or .gif is present as a substring, and does not otherwise check the file name or content)."
