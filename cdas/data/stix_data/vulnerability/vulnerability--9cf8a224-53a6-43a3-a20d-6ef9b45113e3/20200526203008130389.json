    "description": "An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as demonstrated by eu-stack."
