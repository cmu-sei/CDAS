    "description": "phpMyAdmin 3.5.x before 3.5.8 and 4.x before 4.0.0-rc3, when a SaveDir directory is configured, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by using a double extension in the filename of an export file, leading to interpretation of this file as an executable file by the Apache HTTP Server, as demonstrated by a .php.sql filename."
