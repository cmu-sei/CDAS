    "description": "In SLP Validate (npm package slp-validate) before version 1.2.1, users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton. This has been fixed in slp-validate in version 1.2.1. Additonally, slpjs version 0.27.2 has a related fix under related CVE-2020-11071."
