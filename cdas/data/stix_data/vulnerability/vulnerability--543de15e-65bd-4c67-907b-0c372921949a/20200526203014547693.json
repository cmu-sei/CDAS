    "description": "Certain Xerox WorkCentre printers before 073.xxx.000.02300 do not require the user to reenter or validate LDAP bind credentials when changing the LDAP connector IP address. A malicious actor who gains access to affected devices (e.g., by using default credentials) can change the LDAP connection IP address to a system owned by the actor without knowledge of the LDAP bind credentials. After changing the LDAP connection IP address, subsequent authentication attempts will result in the printer sending plaintext LDAP (Active Directory) credentials to the actor. Although the credentials may belong to a non-privileged user, organizations frequently use privileged service accounts to bind to Active Directory. The attacker gains a foothold on the Active Directory domain at a minimum, and may use the credentials to take over control of the Active Directory domain. This affects 3655*, 3655i*, 58XX*, 58XXi*, 59XX*, 59XXi*, 6655**, 6655i**, 72XX*, 72XXi*, 78XX**, 78XXi**, 7970**, 7970i**, EC7836**, and EC7856** devices."
