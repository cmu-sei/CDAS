    "description": "An authenticated shell command injection issue has been discovered in Raisecom ISCOM HT803G-U, HT803G-W, HT803G-1GE, and HT803G GPON products with the firmware version ISCOMHT803G-U_2.0.0_140521_R4.1.47.002 or below. The value of the fmgpon_loid parameter is used in a system call inside the boa binary. Because there is no user input validation, this leads to authenticated code execution on the device."
