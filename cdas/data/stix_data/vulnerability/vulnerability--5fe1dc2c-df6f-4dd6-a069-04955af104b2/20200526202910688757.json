    "description": "The ASN1_TYPE_cmp function in crypto/asn1/a_type.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not properly perform boolean-type comparisons, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read operation and application crash) via a crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the certificate-verification feature."
