    "description": "Missing Authentication for Critical Function in the Bosch Video Streaming Gateway (VSG) allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve and set arbitrary configuration data of the Video Streaming Gateway. A successful attack can impact the confidentiality and availability of live and recorded video data of all cameras configured to be controlled by the VSG as well as the recording storage associated with the VSG. This affects Bosch Video Streaming Gateway versions 6.45 <= 6.45.08, 6.44 <= 6.44.022, 6.43 <= 6.43.0023 and 6.42.10 and older. This affects Bosch DIVAR IP 3000, DIVAR IP 7000 and DIVAR IP all-in-one 5000 if a vulnerable VSG version is installed with BVMS. This affects Bosch DIVAR IP 2000 <= 3.62.0019 and DIVAR IP 5000 <= 3.80.0039 if the corresponding port 8023 has been opened in the device's firewall."
