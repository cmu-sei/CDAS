    "description": "WolfVision Cynap before 1.30j uses a static, hard-coded cryptographic secret for generating support PINs for the 'forgot password' feature. By knowing this static secret and the corresponding algorithm for calculating support PINs, an attacker can reset the ADMIN password and thus gain remote access."
