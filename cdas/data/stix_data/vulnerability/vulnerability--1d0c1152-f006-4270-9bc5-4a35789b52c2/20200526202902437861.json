    "description": "The mISDN_sock_recvmsg function in drivers/isdn/mISDN/socket.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4 does not ensure that a certain length value is consistent with the size of an associated data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system call."
