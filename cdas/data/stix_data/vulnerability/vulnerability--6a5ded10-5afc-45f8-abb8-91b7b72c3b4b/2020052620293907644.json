    "description": "The sg_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large command size in an SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN ioctl call, leading to out-of-bounds write access in the sg_write function."
