    "description": "The dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-wccp.c in the WCCP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.6 does not properly determine whether enough memory is available for storing IP address strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet."
