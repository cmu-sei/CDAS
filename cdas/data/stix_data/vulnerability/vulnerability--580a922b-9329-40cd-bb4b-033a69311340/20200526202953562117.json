    "description": "If the \"\"app.support.baseURL\"\" preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads \"\"chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul\"\" directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59."
