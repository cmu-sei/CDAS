    "description": "The Inetc plugin for Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), as used in CERT/CC Failure Observation Engine (FOE) and other products, does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted certificate in a download session for Windows executable files."
