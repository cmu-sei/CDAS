    "description": "Analysis of the Bomgar Remote Support Portal JavaStart.jar Applet 52790 and earlier revealed that it is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. The archive can be downloaded from a given Bomgar Remote Support Portal deployment at https://domain/api/content/JavaStart.jar and is callable from an arbitrary website using <object> and/or <appletHTML> tags. Successful exploitation results in file creation/modification/deletion in the operating system and with privileges of the user that ran the Java applet."
