    "description": "The SAML 2.0 implementation in AdNovum nevisAuth 4.13.0.0 before 4.18.3.1, when using SAML POST-Binding, does not match all attributes of the X.509 certificate embedded in the assertion against the certificate from the identity provider (IdP), which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SAML assertions via a crafted certificate."
