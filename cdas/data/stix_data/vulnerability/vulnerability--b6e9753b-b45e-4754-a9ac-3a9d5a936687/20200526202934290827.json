    "description": "Directory traversal in the HTTP server on Yawcam 0.2.6 through 0.6.0 devices allows attackers to read arbitrary files through a sequence of the form '.x./' or '....\\x/' where x is a pattern composed of one or more (zero or more for the second pattern) of either \\ or ..\\ -- for example a '.\\./', '....\\/' or '...\\./' sequence. For files with no extension, a single dot needs to be appended to ensure the HTTP server does not alter the request, e.g., a \"\"GET /.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts.\"\" request."
