    "description": "The RenderCounter::updateCounter function in core/rendering/RenderCounter.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, does not force a relayout operation and consequently does not initialize memory for a data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequence."
