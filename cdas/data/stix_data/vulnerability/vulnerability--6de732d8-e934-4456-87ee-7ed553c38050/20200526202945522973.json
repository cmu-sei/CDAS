    "description": "Dell EMC iDRAC6, versions prior to 2.91, iDRAC7/iDRAC8, versions prior to 2.60.60.60 and iDRAC9, versions prior to 3.21.21.21, contain a weak CGI session ID vulnerability. The sessions invoked via CGI binaries use 96-bit numeric-only session ID values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to perform bruteforce session guessing attacks."
