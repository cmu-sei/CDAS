    "description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS recursor before 4.0.4, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of an AXFR because of insufficient validation of TSIG signatures. A missing check that the TSIG record is the last one, leading to the possibility of parsing records that are not covered by the TSIG signature."
