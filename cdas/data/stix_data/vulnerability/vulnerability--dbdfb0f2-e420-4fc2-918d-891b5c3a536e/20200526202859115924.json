    "description": "java/org/apache/catalina/core/AsyncContextImpl.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.40 does not properly handle the throwing of a RuntimeException in an AsyncListener in an application, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive request information intended for other applications in opportunistic circumstances via an application that records the requests that it processes."
