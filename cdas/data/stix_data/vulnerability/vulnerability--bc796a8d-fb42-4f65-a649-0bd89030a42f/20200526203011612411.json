    "description": "OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that inject authentication results to provide false information about the domain that originated an e-mail message. This is caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM authentication results, as demonstrated by the example.net(.example.com substring."
