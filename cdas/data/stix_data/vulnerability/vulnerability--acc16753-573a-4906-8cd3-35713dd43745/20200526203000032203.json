    "description": "Some Kyocera printers (such as the ECOSYS M5526cdw 2R7_2000.001.701) were affected by multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the IPP service. This would allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device."
