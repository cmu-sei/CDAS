    "description": "In Aruba ClearPass, disabled API admins can still perform read/write operations. In certain circumstances, API admins in ClearPass which have been disabled may still be able to perform read/write operations on parts of the XML API. This can lead to unauthorized access to the API and complete compromise of the ClearPass instance if an attacker knows of the existence of these accounts."
