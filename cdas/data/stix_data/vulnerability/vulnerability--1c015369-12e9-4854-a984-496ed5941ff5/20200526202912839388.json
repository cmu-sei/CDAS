    "description": "The WebUI component in Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance SV800, SV1800, SV2800, and SV3800 3.6.x through 3.8.x before 3.8.4 does not set the secure flag for the administrator's cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-4138."
