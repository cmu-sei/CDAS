    "description": "A certain Red Hat patch to the do_filp_open function in fs/namei.c in the kernel package before 2.6.32-358.11.1.el6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 does not properly handle failure to obtain write permissions, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging access to a filesystem that is mounted read-only."
