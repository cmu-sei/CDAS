    "description": "The Python client library for Glance (python-glanceclient) before 0.10.0 does not properly check the preverify_ok value, which prevents the server hostname from being verified with a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate and allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate."
