    "description": "The PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729 server does not properly escape data before writing it into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. This can be used by attackers to hide data in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) view and create arbitrary entries to a certain extent. Special characters such as '\"\"' and ',' and '\\r' are not escaped and can be used to add new entries to the log."
