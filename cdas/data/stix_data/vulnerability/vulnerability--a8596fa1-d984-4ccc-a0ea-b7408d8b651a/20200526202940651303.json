    "description": "The NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel before 4.11.3 does not properly validate the layout type when processing the NFSv4 pNFS GETDEVICEINFO or LAYOUTGET operand in a UDP packet from a remote attacker. This type value is uninitialized upon encountering certain error conditions. This value is used as an array index for dereferencing, which leads to an OOPS and eventually a DoS of knfsd and a soft-lockup of the whole system."
