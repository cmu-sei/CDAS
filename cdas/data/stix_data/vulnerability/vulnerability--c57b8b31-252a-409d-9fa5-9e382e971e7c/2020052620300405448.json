    "name": "CVE-2019-19332",
    "description": "An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the Linux Kernel, version 3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID' ioctl(2) request to get CPUID features emulated by the KVM hypervisor. A user or process able to access the '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service."
