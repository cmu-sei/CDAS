    "description": "The ipv6_create_tempaddr function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8 does not properly handle problems with the generation of IPv6 temporary addresses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain sensitive information, via ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages."
