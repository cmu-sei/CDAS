    "description": "When BIG-IP 14.0.0-14.0.0.2, 13.0.0-13.1.0.5, 12.1.0-12.1.3.5, 11.6.0-11.6.3.2, or 11.2.1-11.5.6, BIG-IQ Centralized Management 5.0.0-5.4.0 or 4.6.0, BIG-IQ Cloud and Orchestration 1.0.0, iWorkflow 2.1.0-2.3.0, or Enterprise Manager 3.1.1 is licensed for Appliance Mode, Admin and Resource administrator roles can by-pass BIG-IP Appliance Mode restrictions to overwrite critical system files. Attackers of high privilege level are able to overwrite critical system files which bypasses security controls in place to limit TMSH commands. This is possible with an administrator or resource administrator roles when granted TMSH. Resource administrator roles must have TMSH access in order to perform this attack."
