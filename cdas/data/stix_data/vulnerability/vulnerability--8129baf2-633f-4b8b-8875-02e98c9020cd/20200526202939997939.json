    "description": "drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist."
