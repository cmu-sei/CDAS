    "description": "The x86/fpu (Floating Point Unit) subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.13.5, when a processor supports the xsave feature but not the xsaves feature, does not correctly handle attempts to set reserved bits in the xstate header via the ptrace() or rt_sigreturn() system call, allowing local users to read the FPU registers of other processes on the system, related to arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c and arch/x86/kernel/fpu/signal.c."
