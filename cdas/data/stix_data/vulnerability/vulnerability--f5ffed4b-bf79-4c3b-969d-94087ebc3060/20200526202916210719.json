    "description": "The GatewayScript modules on IBM DataPower Gateways with software 7.2.0.x before 7.2.0.1, when the GatewayScript decryption API or a JWE decrypt action is enabled, do not require signed ciphertext data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext data via a padding-oracle attack."
