    "description": "An issue was discovered on the ENTTEC Datagate MK2, Storm 24, Pixelator, and E-Streamer MK2 with firmware 70044_update_05032019-482. They include a hard-coded SSH backdoor for remote SSH and SCP access as the root user. A command in the relocate and relocate_revB scripts copies the hardcoded key to the root user's authorized_keys file, enabling anyone with the associated private key to gain remote root access to all affected products."
