    "description": "The sqlite3VdbeExec function in vdbe.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement comparison operators, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free operation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted CHECK clause, as demonstrated by CHECK(0&O>O) in a CREATE TABLE statement."
