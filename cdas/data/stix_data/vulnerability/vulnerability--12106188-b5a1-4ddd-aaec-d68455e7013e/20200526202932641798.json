    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The certificate import component in IDEMIA (formerly Morpho) MorphoSmart 1300 Series (aka MSO 1300 Series) devices allows local users to obtain a command shell, and consequently gain privileges, via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this because there is no command shell in the product or in the associated SDK."
