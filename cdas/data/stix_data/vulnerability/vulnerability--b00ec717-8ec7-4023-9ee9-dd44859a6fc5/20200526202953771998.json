    "description": "The PrinterLogic Print Management software, versions up to and including 18.3.1.96, does not validate, or incorrectly validates, the PrinterLogic management portal's SSL certificate. When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host."
