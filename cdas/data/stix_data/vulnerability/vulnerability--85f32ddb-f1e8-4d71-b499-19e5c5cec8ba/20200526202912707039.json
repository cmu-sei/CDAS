    "description": "net/socket.c in the Linux kernel 3.19 before 3.19.3 does not validate certain range data for (1) sendto and (2) recvfrom system calls, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging a subsystem that uses the copy_from_iter function in the iov_iter interface, as demonstrated by the Bluetooth subsystem."
