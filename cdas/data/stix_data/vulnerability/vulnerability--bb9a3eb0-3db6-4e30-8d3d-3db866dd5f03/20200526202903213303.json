    "description": "The kgsl graphics driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not properly prevent write access to IOMMU context registers, which allows local users to select a custom page table, and consequently write to arbitrary memory locations, by using a crafted GPU command stream to modify the contents of a certain register."
