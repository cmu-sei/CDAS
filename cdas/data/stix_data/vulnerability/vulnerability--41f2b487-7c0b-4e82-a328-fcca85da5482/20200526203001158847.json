The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a system crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. The highest threat with this vulnerability is with the availability of the system. If code execution occurs, the code will run with the permissions of root. This will affect both confidentiality and integrity of files on the system."
