    "name": "CVE-2018-11682",
    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Default and unremovable support credentials allow attackers to gain total super user control of an IoT device through a TELNET session to products using the Stanza Lutron integration protocol Revision M to Revision Y. NOTE: The vendor disputes this id as not being a vulnerability because what can be done through the ports revolve around controlling lighting, not code execution. A certain set of commands are listed, which bear some similarity to code, but they are not arbitrary and do not allow admin-level control of a machine."
