    "name": "CVE-2018-19046",
    "description": "keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for existing plain files when writing data to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. If a local attacker had previously created a file with the expected name (e.g., /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats), with read access for the attacker and write access for the keepalived process, then this potentially leaked sensitive information."
