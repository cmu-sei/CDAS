    "description": "keystone/middleware/auth_token.py in OpenStack Nova Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana uses an insecure temporary directory for storing signing certificates, which allows local users to spoof servers by pre-creating this directory, which is reused by Nova, as demonstrated using /tmp/keystone-signing-nova on Fedora."
