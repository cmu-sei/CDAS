    "description": "In Eclipse OpenJ9, prior to the 0.12.0 release, the jio_snprintf() and jio_vsnprintf() native methods ignored the length parameter. This affects existing APIs that called the functions to exceed the allocated buffer. This functions were not directly callable by non-native user code."
