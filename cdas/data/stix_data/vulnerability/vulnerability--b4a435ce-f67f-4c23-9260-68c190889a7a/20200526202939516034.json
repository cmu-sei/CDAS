    "description": "dde-daemon, the daemon process of DDE (Deepin Desktop Environment) 15.0 through 15.3, runs with root privileges and hardly does anything to identify the user who calls the function through D-Bus. Anybody can change the grub config, even to append some arguments to make a backdoor or privilege escalation, by calling DoWriteGrubSettings() provided by dde-daemon."
