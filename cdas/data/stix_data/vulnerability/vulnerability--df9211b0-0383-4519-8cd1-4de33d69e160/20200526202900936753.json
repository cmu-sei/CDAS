    "description": "cURL and libcurl 7.18.0 through 7.32.0, when built with OpenSSL, disables the certificate CN and SAN name field verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST) when the digital signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER) is disabled, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate."
