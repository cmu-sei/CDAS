    "description": "In all Kubernetes versions prior to v1.11.8, v1.12.6, and v1.13.4, users that are authorized to make patch requests to the Kubernetes API Server can send a specially crafted patch of type \"\"json-patch\"\" (e.g. `kubectl patch --type json` or `\"\"Content-Type: application/json-patch+json\"\"`) that consumes excessive resources while processing, causing a Denial of Service on the API Server."
