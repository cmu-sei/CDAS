    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 17 and earlier, and OpenJDK 6 and 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Libraries.  NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to incorrect invocation of the defaultReadObject method in the ConcurrentHashMap class, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Java sandbox."
