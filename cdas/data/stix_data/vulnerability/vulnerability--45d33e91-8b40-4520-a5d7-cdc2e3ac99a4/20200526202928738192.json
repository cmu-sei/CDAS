    "description": "Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX series devices do not verify the HTTPS server certificate before downloading anti-virus updates. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject bogus signatures to cause service disruptions or make the device not detect certain types of attacks. Affected Junos OS releases are: 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D71; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D55; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D110;"
