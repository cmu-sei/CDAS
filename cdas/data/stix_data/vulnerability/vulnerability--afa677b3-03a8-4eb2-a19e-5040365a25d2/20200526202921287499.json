    "description": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.75, does not ignore a URL's path component in the case of a ServiceWorker fetch, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about visited web pages by reading CSP violation reports, related to FrameFetchContext.cpp and ResourceFetcher.cpp."
