    "description": "An issue was discovered in Django 1.11 before 1.11.22, 2.1 before 2.1.10, and 2.2 before 2.2.3. An HTTP request is not redirected to HTTPS when the SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER and SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT settings are used, and the proxy connects to Django via HTTPS. In other words, django.http.HttpRequest.scheme has incorrect behavior when a client uses HTTP."
