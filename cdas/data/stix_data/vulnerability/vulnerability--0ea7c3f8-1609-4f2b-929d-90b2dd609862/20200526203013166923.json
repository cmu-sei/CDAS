    "description": "In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, users with the role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role ROLE_ADMIN. ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the name &#8211; implying an admin for a specific course &#8211; users would never expect that this role allows user creation. This issue is fixed in 7.6 and 8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration."
