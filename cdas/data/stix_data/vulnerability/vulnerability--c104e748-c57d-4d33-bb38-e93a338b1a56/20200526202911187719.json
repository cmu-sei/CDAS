    "description": "The WebRTC subsystem in Mozilla Firefox before 36.0 recognizes turns: and stuns: URIs but accesses the TURN or STUN server without using TLS, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to discover credentials by spoofing a server and completing a brute-force attack within a short time window."
