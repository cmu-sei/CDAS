    "description": "WebKit/Source/core/css/StyleSheetContents.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.63, permits cross-origin loading of CSS stylesheets by a ServiceWorker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect MIME type, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site."
