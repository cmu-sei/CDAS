    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The UpdraftPlus plugin through 1.13.12 for WordPress allows remote PHP code execution because the plupload_action function in /wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/admin.php has a race condition before deleting a file associated with the name parameter. NOTE: the vendor reports that this does not cross a privilege boundary."
