    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through 1.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors involving an Immediately Invoked Function Expression \"\"function()\"\" substring, as demonstrated by a \"\"function(){console.log(\"\" call or a simple infinite loop. NOTE: the vendor agrees that denial of service can occur but notes that deserialize is explicitly listed as \"\"harmful\"\" within the README.md file."
