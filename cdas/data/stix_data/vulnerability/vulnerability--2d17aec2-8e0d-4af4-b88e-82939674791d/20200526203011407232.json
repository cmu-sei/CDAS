    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Web Client in Zimbra 9.0 allows a remote attacker to craft links in an E-Mail message or calendar invite to execute arbitrary JavaScript. The attack requires an A element containing an href attribute with a \"\"www\"\" substring (including the quotes) followed immediately by a DOM event listener such as onmouseover. This is fixed in 9.0.0 Patch 2."
