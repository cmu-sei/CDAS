    "description": "KioWare Server version 4.9.6 and older installs by default to \"\"C:\\kioware_com\"\" with weak folder permissions granting any user full permission \"\"Everyone: (F)\"\" to the contents of the directory and it's sub-folders. In addition, the program installs a service called \"\"KWSService\"\" which runs as \"\"Localsystem\"\", this will allow any user to escalate privileges to \"\"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"\" by substituting the service's binary with a malicious one."
