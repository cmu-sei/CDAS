    "description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) 7.3, when PostgreSQL Database is used and return_top_results_row_based config option is false, does not properly restrict DQL hints, which allows remote authenticated users to conduct DQL injection attacks and execute arbitrary DML or DDL commands via a crafted request.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2520."
