    "description": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to craft a packet to the management interface on an affected system, causing a buffer overflow. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the authentication module of the NX-API subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP or HTTPS packet to the management interface of an affected system with the NX-API feature enabled. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. Note: NX-API is disabled by default. This vulnerability affects: MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules.
