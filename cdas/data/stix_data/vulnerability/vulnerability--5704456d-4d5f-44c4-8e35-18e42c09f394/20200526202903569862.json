    "description": "The saltProfileName function in base/GeckoProfileDirectories.java in Mozilla Firefox through 28.0.1 on Android relies on Android's weak approach to seeding the Math.random function, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass a profile-randomization protection mechanism via a crafted application."
