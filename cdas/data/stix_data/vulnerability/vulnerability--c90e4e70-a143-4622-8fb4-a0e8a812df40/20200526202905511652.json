    "description": "The IP Security feature in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.0 and 8.5 does not properly process wildcard allow and deny rules for domains within the \"\"IP Address and Domain Restrictions\"\" list, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass an intended rule set via an HTTP request, aka \"\"IIS Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability."
