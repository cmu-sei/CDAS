    "description": "The MSCAPI/MSCNG interface implementation in GSKit in IBM Rational ClearCase 7.1.2.x before 7.1.2.17, 8.0.0.x before 8.0.0.14, and 8.0.1.x before 8.0.1.7 does not properly generate random numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors."
