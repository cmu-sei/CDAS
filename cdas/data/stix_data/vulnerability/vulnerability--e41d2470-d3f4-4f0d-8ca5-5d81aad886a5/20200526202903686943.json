    "description": "core/html/HTMLSelectElement.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.131 on Windows and OS X and before 34.0.1847.132 on Linux, does not properly check renderer state upon a focus event, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage \"\"type confusion\"\" for SELECT elements."
