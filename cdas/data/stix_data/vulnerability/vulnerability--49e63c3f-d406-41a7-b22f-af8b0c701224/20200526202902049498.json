    "description": "The GnuTLS backend in libcurl 7.21.4 through 7.33.0, when disabling digital signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER), also disables the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check for CN or SAN host name fields, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof servers and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks."
