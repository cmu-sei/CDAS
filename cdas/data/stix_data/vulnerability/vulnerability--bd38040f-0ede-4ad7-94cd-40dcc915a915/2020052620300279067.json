    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities either by injecting malicious code in a chat window or by sending a crafted link to a user of the interface. In both cases, the attacker must persuade the user to click the crafted link or open the chat window that contains the attacker's code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Version 11.6(1) is affected."
