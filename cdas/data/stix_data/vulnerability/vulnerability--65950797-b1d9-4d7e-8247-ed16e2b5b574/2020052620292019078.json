    "description": "The TCP implementation in Cisco Videoscape Distribution Suite for Internet Streaming (VDS-IS) 3.3(0), 3.3(1), 4.0(0), and 4.1(0) does not properly initiate new TCP sessions when a previous session is in a FIN wait state, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (TCP outage) via vectors involving FIN packets, aka Bug ID CSCuy45136."
