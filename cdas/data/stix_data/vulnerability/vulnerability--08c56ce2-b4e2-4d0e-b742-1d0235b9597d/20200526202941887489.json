    "description": "An unauthenticated root login may allow upon reboot when a commit script is used. A commit script allows a device administrator to execute certain instructions during commit, which is configured under the [system scripts commit] stanza. Certain commit scripts that work without a problem during normal commit may cause unexpected behavior upon reboot which can leave the system in a state where root CLI login is allowed without a password due to the system reverting to a \"\"safe mode\"\" authentication state. Lastly, only logging in physically to the console port as root, with no password, will work.
