    "description": "The \"\"go get\"\" implementation in Go 1.9.4, when the -insecure command-line option is used, does not validate the import path (get/vcs.go only checks for \"\"://\"\" anywhere in the string), which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site."
