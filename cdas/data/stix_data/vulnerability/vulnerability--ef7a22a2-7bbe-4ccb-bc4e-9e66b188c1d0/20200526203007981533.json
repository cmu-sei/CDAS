    "description": "A heap-based buffer over-read in Service_SetParamStringValue in cosa_x_cisco_com_ddns_dml.c of the RDK RDKB-20181217-1 CcspPandM module may allow attackers with login credentials to achieve information disclosure and code execution by crafting an AJAX call responsible for DDNS configuration with an exactly 64-byte username, password, or domain, for which the buffer size is insufficient for the final '\\0' character. This is related to the CcspCommonLibrary and WebUI modules."
