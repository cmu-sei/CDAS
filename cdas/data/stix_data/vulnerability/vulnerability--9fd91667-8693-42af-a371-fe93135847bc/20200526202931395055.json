    "name": "CVE-2017-14102",
    "description": "MIMEDefang 2.80 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a \"\"kill `cat /pathname`\"\" command, as demonstrated by the init-script.in and mimedefang-init.in scripts."
