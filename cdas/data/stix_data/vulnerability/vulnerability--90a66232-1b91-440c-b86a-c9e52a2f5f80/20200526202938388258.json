    "description": "An issue was discovered on Dahua DHI-HCVR7216A-S3 devices with NVR Firmware 3.210.0001.10 2016-06-06, Camera Firmware 2.400.0000.28.R 2016-03-29, and SmartPSS Software 1.16.1 2017-01-19. When SmartPSS Software is launched, while on the login screen, the software in the background automatically logs in as admin. This allows sniffing sensitive information identified in CVE-2017-6341 without prior knowledge of the password. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-6117."
