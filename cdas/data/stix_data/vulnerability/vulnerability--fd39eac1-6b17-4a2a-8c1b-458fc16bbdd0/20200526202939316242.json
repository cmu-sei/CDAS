    "description": "In Sophos SurfRight HitmanPro before 3.7.20 Build 286 (included in the HitmanPro.Alert solution and Sophos Clean), a crafted IOCTL with code 0x22E1C0 might lead to kernel data leaks. Because the leak occurs at the driver level, an attacker can use this vulnerability to leak some critical information about the machine such as nt!ExpPoolQuotaCookie."
