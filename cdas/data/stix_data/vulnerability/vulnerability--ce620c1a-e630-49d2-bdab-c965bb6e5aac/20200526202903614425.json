    "description": "The Public Key Pinning (PKP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0 skips pinning checks upon an unspecified issuer-verification error, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass an intended pinning configuration and spoof a web site via a crafted certificate that leads to presentation of the Untrusted Connection dialog to the user."
