    "description": "The WifiPasswordController generateDefaultPassword method in Preferences in Apple iOS 6 and earlier relies on the UITextChecker suggestWordInLanguage method for selection of Wi-Fi hotspot WPA2 PSK passphrases, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack that leverages the insufficient number of possible passphrases."
