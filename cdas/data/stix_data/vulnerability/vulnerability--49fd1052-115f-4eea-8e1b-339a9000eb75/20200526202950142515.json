    "description": "osCommerce 2.3.4.1 has an incomplete '.htaccess' for blacklist filtering in the \"\"product\"\" page. The .htaccess file in catalog/images/ bans the html extension, but there are several alternative cases in which HTML can be executed, such as a file with no extension or an unrecognized extension (e.g., the test or test.asdf filename)."
