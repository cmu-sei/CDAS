    "description": "The passwordCheck function in SAP Router 721 patch 117, 720 patch 411, 710 patch 029, and earlier terminates validation of a Route Permission Table entry password upon encountering the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack."
