    "description": "The EAP peer implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF 2.0.0 through 4.0.0 and ESP8266_NONOS_SDK 2.2.0 through 3.1.0 processes EAP Success messages before any EAP method completion or failure, which allows attackers in radio range to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted message."
