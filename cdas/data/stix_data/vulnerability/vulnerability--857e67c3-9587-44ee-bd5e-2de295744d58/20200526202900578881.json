    "description": "Juniper Junos Pulse Secure Access Service (aka SSL VPN) with IVE OS 7.0r2 through 7.0r8 and 7.1r1 through 7.1r5 and Junos Pulse Access Control Service (aka UAC) with UAC OS 4.1r1 through 4.1r5 include a test Certification Authority (CA) certificate in the Trusted Server CAs list, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging control over that test CA."
