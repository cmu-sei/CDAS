    "description": "The com.ibm.rmi.io.SunSerializableFactory class in IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition 6 before SR16 FP25 (6.0.16.25), 6 R1 before SR8 FP25 (6.1.8.25), 7 before SR9 FP40 (7.0.9.40), 7 R1 before SR3 FP40 (7.1.3.40), and 8 before SR3 (8.0.3.0) does not properly deserialize classes in an AccessController doPrivileged block, which allows remote attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism and execute arbitrary code as demonstrated by the readValue method of the com.ibm.rmi.io.ValueHandlerPool.ValueHandlerSingleton class, which implements the javax.rmi.CORBA.ValueHandler interface.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-5456."
