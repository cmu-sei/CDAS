    "description": "The elf_object_p function in elfcode.h in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, has an unsigned integer overflow because bfd_size_type multiplication is not used. A crafted ELF file allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact."
