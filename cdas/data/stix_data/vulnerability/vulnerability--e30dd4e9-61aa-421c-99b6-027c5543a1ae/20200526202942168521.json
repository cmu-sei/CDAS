    "description": "A vulnerability in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) Snooping feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system. The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow condition in the IGMP Snooping subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP packets to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode.
