    "description": "The hardware VPN client in Viprinet MultichannelVPN Router 300 version 2013070830/2013080900 does not validate the remote VPN endpoint identity (through the checking of the endpoint's SSL key) before initiating the exchange, which allows an attacker to perform a Man in the Middle attack."
