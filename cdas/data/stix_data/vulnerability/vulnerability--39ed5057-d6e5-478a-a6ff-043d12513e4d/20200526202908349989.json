    "description": "The xfs_da3_fixhashpath function in fs/xfs/xfs_da_btree.c in the xfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.14.2 does not properly compare btree hash values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (filesystem corruption, and OOPS or panic) via operations on directories that have hash collisions, as demonstrated by rmdir operations."
