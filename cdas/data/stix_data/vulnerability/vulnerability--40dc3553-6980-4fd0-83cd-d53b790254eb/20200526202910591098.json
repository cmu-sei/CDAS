    "description": "The HTTP connection-management functionality in Internet Pass-Thru (IPT) before 2.1.0.2 in IBM WebSphere MQ, when HTTPS is disabled, does not properly generate MQIPT Session IDs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions on MQ message data by predicting an ID value."
