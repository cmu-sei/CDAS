    "name": "CVE-2019-9506",
    "description": "The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka \"\"KNOB\"\") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing."
