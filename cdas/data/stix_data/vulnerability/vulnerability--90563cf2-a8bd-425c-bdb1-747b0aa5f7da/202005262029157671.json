    "description": "The Document::open function in WebKit/Source/core/dom/Document.cpp in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73 does not ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal-dialog blocking, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof Omnibox content via a crafted web site."
