    "description": "The HTTPS implementation in Google Chrome before 28.0.1500.71 does not ensure that headers are terminated by \\r\\n\\r\\n (carriage return, newline, carriage return, newline), which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to have an unspecified impact via vectors that trigger header truncation."
