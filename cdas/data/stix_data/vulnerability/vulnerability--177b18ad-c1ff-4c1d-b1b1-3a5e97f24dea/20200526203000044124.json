    "description": "A use-after-free in onig_new_deluxe() in regext.c in Oniguruma 6.9.2 allows attackers to potentially cause information disclosure, denial of service, or possibly code execution by providing a crafted regular expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern and a string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by onig_new_deluxe(). Oniguruma issues often affect Ruby, as well as common optional libraries for PHP and Rust."
