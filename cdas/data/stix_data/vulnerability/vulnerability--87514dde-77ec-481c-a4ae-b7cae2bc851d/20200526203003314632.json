The vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates input on fields within IAPP messages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious IAPP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco WLC Software to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Software versions prior to 8.2.170.0, 8.5.150.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected."
