    "description": "The SMI-S service in Dell Storage Manager versions earlier than 16.3.20 (aka 2016 R3.20) is protected using a hard-coded password. A remote user with the knowledge of the password might potentially disable the SMI-S service via HTTP requests, affecting storage management and monitoring functionality via the SMI-S interface. This issue, aka DSM-30415, only affects a Windows installation of the Data Collector (not applicable to the virtual appliance)."
