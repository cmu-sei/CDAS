    "description": "PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in the fetchView function in the Mage_Core_Block_Template_Zend class in Magento Community Edition (CE) 1.9.1.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE) 1.14.1.0 allows remote administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in unspecified vectors involving the setScriptPath function.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries, since administrators might already have privileges to include arbitrary files."
