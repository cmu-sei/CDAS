    "description": "The keyctl_read_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.4 does not properly use a semaphore, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that leverages a race condition between keyctl_revoke and keyctl_read calls."
