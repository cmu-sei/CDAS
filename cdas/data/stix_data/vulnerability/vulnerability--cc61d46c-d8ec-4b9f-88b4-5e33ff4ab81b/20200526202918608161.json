    "description": "The caching functionality in the TrustManagerImpl class in TrustManagerImpl.java in Conscrypt in Android 4.x before 4.4.4, 5.x before 5.1.1 LMY49H, and 6.x before 2016-03-01 mishandles the distinction between an intermediate CA and a trusted root CA, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers by leveraging access to an intermediate CA to issue a certificate, aka internal bug 26232830."
