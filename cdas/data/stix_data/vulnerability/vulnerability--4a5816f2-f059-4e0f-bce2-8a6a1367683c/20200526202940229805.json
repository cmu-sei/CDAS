    "name": "CVE-2017-8284",
    "description": "** DISPUTED ** The disas_insn function in target/i386/translate.c in QEMU before 2.9.0, when TCG mode without hardware acceleration is used, does not limit the instruction size, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a modified basic block that injects code into a setuid program, as demonstrated by procmail. NOTE: the vendor has stated \"\"this bug does not violate any security guarantees QEMU makes."
