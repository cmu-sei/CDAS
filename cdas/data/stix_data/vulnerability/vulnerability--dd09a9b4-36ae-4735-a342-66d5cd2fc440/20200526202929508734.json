    "description": "NixOS 17.03 and earlier has an unintended default absence of SSL Certificate Validation for LDAP. The users.ldap NixOS module implements user authentication against LDAP servers via a PAM module. It was found that if TLS is enabled to connect to the LDAP server with users.ldap.useTLS, peer verification will be unconditionally disabled in /etc/ldap.conf."
