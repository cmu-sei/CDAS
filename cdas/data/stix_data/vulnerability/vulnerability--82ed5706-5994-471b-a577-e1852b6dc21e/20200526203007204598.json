    "description": "Authenticated, administrative access to a Barracuda Load Balancer ADC running unpatched firmware <= v6.4 allows one to edit the LDAP service configuration of the balancer and change the LDAP server to an attacker-controlled system, without having to re-enter LDAP credentials. These steps can be used by any authenticated administrative user to expose the LDAP credentials configured in the LDAP connector over the network."
