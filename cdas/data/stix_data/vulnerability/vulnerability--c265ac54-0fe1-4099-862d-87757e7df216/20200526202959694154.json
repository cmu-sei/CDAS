    "description": "An issue was discovered in Digital Persona U.are.U 4500 Fingerprint Reader v24. The key and salt used for obfuscating the fingerprint image exhibit cleartext when the fingerprint scanner device transfers a fingerprint image to the driver. An attacker who sniffs an encrypted fingerprint image can easily decrypt that image using the key and salt."
