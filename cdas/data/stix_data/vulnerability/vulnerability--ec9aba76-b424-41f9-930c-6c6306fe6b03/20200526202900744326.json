    "description": "The ssl.match_hostname function in the SSL module in Python 2.6 through 3.4 does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408."
