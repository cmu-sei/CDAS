    "description": "ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms of .tar (Tape Archive) files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a checksum buffer over-read condition when ClamAV scans the malicious .tar file, potentially allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device."
