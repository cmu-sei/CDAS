    "description": "The _views_fetch_data method in includes/cache.inc in the Views module 7.x-3.5 through 7.x-3.10 for Drupal does not rebuild the full cache if the static cache is not empty, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended filters and obtain access to hidden content via unspecified vectors."
