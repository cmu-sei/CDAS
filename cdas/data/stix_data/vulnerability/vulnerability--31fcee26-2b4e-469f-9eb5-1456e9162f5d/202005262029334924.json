    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager 7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.designer.script_005fsamples_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the type parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5119."
