    "description": "Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.16.2.1, 3.16.x before 3.16.5, and 3.17.x before 3.17.1, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 32.0.3, Mozilla Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.8.1 and 31.x before 31.1.1, Mozilla Thunderbird before 24.8.1 and 31.x before 31.1.2, Mozilla SeaMonkey before 2.29.1, Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.124 on Windows and OS X, and Google Chrome OS before 37.0.2062.120, does not properly parse ASN.1 values in X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof RSA signatures via a crafted certificate, aka a \"\"signature malleability\"\" issue."
