    "description": "Path traversal in RadChart in Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX allows a remote attacker to read and delete an image with extension .BMP, .EXIF, .GIF, .ICON, .JPEG, .PNG, .TIFF, or .WMF on the server through a specially crafted request. NOTE: RadChart was discontinued in 2014 in favor of RadHtmlChart. All RadChart versions were affected. To avoid this vulnerability, you must remove RadChart's HTTP handler from a web.config (its type is Telerik.Web.UI.ChartHttpHandler)."
