    "description": "browser/ui/website_settings/website_settings.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not always display \"\"Media: Allowed by you\"\" in a Permissions table after the user has granted camera permission to a web site, which might make it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to obtain sensitive video data from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that turns on the camera at a time when the user believes that camera access is prohibited."
