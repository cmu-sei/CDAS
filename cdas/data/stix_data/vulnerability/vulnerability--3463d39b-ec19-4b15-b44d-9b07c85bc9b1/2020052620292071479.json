    "description": "The nsCSPContext::SendReports function in dom/security/nsCSPContext.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 45.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.7 does not prevent use of a non-HTTP report-uri for a Content Security Policy (CSP) violation report, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (data overwrite) or possibly gain privileges by specifying a URL of a local file."
