    "description": "A vulnerability in the UDP protocol implementation for Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper resource management for UDP ingress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP packets to an affected system within a short period of time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available system resources, resulting in a DoS condition."
