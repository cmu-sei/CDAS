    "name": "CVE-2013-5935",
    "description": "The Hazelcast cluster API in Open-Xchange AppSuite 7.0.x before 7.0.2-rev15 and 7.2.x before 7.2.2-rev16 does not properly restrict the set of network interfaces that can receive API calls, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by sending network traffic from an unintended location, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-5200."
