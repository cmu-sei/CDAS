    "name": "CVE-2017-3188",
    "description": "The dotCMS administration panel, versions 3.7.1 and earlier, \"\"Push Publishing\"\" feature in Enterprise Pro is vulnerable to path traversal. When \"\"Bundle\"\" tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, the filenames of its contents are not properly checked, allowing for writing files to arbitrary directories on the file system. These archives may be uploaded directly via the administrator panel, or using the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2017-3187). An unauthenticated remote attacker may perform actions with the dotCMS administrator panel with the same permissions of a victim user or execute arbitrary system commands with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application."
