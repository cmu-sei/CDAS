    "description": "The cineon parsing component in ImageMagick 7.0.8-26 Q16 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (uncontrolled resource consumption) by crafting a Cineon image with an incorrect claimed image size. This occurs because ReadCINImage in coders/cin.c lacks a check for insufficient image data in a file."
