    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 22.0, Firefox ESR 17.x before 17.0.7, Thunderbird before 17.0.7, and Thunderbird ESR 17.x before 17.0.7 do not prevent the inclusion of body data in an XMLHttpRequest HEAD request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via a crafted web site."
