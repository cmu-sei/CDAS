    "description": "The verify endpoint in YubiKey Validation Server before 2.40 does not check the length of SQL queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, aka SQL injection. NOTE: this issue is potentially relevant to persons outside Yubico who operate a self-hosted OTP validation service; the issue does NOT affect YubiCloud."
