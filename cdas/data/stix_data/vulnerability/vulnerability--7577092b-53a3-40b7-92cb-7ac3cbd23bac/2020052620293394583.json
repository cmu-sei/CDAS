    "description": "Huawei DP300 V500R002C00; TP3206 V100R002C00; ViewPoint 9030 V100R011C02; V100R011C03 have a use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm vulnerability. The software uses risky cryptographic algorithm in SSL. This is dangerous because a remote unauthenticated attacker could use well-known techniques to break the algorithm. Successful exploit could result in the exposure of sensitive information."
