    "description": "The CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch function in core/css/CSSFontFaceSrcValue.cpp in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.71, does not use the CORS cross-origin request algorithm when a font's URL appears to be a same-origin URL, which allows remote web servers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a redirect."
