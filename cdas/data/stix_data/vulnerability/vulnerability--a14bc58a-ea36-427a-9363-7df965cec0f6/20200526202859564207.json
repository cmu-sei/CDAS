    "description": "The DTLS dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.14 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6 does not validate the fragment offset before invoking the reassembly state machine, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a large offset value that triggers write access to an invalid memory location."
