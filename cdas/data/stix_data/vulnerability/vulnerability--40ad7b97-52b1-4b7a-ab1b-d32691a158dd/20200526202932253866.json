    "name": "CVE-2017-15012",
    "description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 does not properly validate the input of the PUT_FILE RPC-command, which allows any authenticated user to hijack an arbitrary file from the Content Server filesystem; because some files on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this leads to privilege escalation."
