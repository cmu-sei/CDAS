    "name": "CVE-2019-16303",
    "description": "A class generated by the Generator in JHipster before 6.3.0 and JHipster Kotlin through 1.1.0 produces code that uses an insecure source of randomness (apache.commons.lang3 RandomStringUtils). This allows an attacker (if able to obtain their own password reset URL) to compute the value for all other password resets for other accounts, thus allowing privilege escalation or account takeover."
