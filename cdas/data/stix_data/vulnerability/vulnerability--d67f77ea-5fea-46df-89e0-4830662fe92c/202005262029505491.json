    "description": "DriverAgent 2.2015.7.14, which includes DrvAgent64.sys 1.0.0.1, allows a user to send an IOCTL (0x80002068) with a user defined buffer size. If the size of the buffer is less than 512 bytes, then the driver will overwrite the next pool header if there is one next to the user buffer's pool."
