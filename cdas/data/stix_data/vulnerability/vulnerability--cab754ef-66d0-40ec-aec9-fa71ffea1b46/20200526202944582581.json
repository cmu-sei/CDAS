    "description": "An issue was discovered in Moodle 3.x. An authenticated user is allowed to add HTML blocks containing scripts to their Dashboard; this is normally not a security issue because a personal dashboard is visible to this user only. Through this security vulnerability, users can move such a block to other pages where they can be viewed by other users."
