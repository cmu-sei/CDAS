    "description": "The Expressway component in Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) uses the same default X.509 certificate across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship, aka Bug ID CSCue07471."
