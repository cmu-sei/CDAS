    "description": "The AsyncPixelTransfersCompletedQuery::End function in gpu/command_buffer/service/query_manager.cc in Google Chrome, as used in Google Chrome OS before 33.0.1750.152, does not check whether a certain position is within the bounds of a shared-memory segment, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (GPU command-buffer memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors."
