    "description": "GE Multilink ML800, ML1200, ML1600, and ML2400 switches with firmware 4.2.1 and earlier and Multilink ML810, ML3000, and ML3100 switches with firmware 5.2.0 and earlier use the same RSA private key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the cleartext content of network traffic by reading this key from a firmware image and then sniffing the network."
