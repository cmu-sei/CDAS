    "description": "In Sophos Tester Tool 3.2.0.7 Beta, the driver accepts a special DeviceIoControl code that doesn't check its argument. This argument is a memory address: if a caller passes a NULL pointer or a random invalid address, the driver will cause a Blue Screen of Death. If a program or malware does this at boot time, it can cause a persistent denial of service on the machine."
