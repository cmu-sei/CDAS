    "description": "The guestfish command in libguestfs 1.20.12, 1.22.7, and earlier, when using the --remote or --listen option, does not properly check the ownership of /tmp/.guestfish-$UID/ when creating a temporary socket file in this directory, which allows local users to write to the socket and execute arbitrary commands by creating /tmp/.guestfish-$UID/ in advance."
