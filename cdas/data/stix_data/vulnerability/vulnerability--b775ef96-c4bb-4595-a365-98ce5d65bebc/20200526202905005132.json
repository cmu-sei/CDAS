    "description": "The cdf_count_chain function in cdf.c in file before 5.19, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14, does not properly validate sector-count data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted CDF file."
