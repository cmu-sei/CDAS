The vulnerability is due to an insecure default configuration of the Apache ZooKeeper service used by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the affected device through the orchestrator network. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to ZooKeeper data nodes (znodes) and influence the behavior of the system's high-availability feature. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco Ultra Services Framework UAS prior to Releases 5.0.3 and 5.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd29395."
