    "description": "** DISPUTED ** chmextract.c in the chmextract sample program, as distributed with libmspack before 0.8alpha, does not protect against absolute/relative pathnames in CHM files, leading to Directory Traversal. NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a libmspack vulnerability, because chmextract.c was only intended as a source-code example, not a supported application."
