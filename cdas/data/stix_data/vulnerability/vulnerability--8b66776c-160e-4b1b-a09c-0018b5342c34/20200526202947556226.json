    "description": "When F5 BIG-IP 13.0.0-13.1.0.5, 12.1.0-12.1.3.5, 11.6.0-11.6.3.2, or 11.5.1-11.5.6 is processing specially crafted TCP traffic with the Large Receive Offload (LRO) feature enabled, TMM may crash, leading to a failover event. This vulnerability is not exposed unless LRO is enabled, so most affected customers will be on 13.1.x. LRO has been available since 11.4.0 but is not enabled by default until 13.1.0."
