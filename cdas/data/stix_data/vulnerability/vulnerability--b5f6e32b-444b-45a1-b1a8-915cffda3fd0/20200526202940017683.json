    "name": "CVE-2017-8082",
    "description": "concrete5 8.1.0 has CSRF in Thumbnail Editor in the File Manager, which allows remote attackers to disable the entire installation by merely tricking an admin into viewing a malicious page involving the /tools/required/files/importers/imageeditor?fID=1&imgData= URI. This results in a site-wide denial of service making the site not accessible to any users or any administrators."
