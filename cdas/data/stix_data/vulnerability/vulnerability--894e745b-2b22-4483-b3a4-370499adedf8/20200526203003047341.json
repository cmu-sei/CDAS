    "name": "CVE-2019-17362",
    "description": "In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data."
