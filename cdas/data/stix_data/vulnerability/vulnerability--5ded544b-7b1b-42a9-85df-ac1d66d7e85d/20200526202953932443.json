The pre-defined function \"\"strlen\"\" is getting a \"\"NULL\"\" string as a parameter value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified kadmin client."
