    "description": "The file_check_mem function in funcs.c in file before 5.23, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.5.34, 5.6.x before 5.6.20, and 7.x before 7.0.5, mishandles continuation-level jumps, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted magic file."
