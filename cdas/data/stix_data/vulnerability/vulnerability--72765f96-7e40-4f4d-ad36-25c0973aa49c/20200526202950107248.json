    "name": "CVE-2018-18920",
    "description": "Py-EVM v0.2.0-alpha.33 allows attackers to make a vm.execute_bytecode call that triggers computation._stack.values with '\"\"stack\"\": [100, 100, 0]' where b'\\x' was expected, resulting in an execution failure because of an invalid opcode. This is reportedly related to \"\"smart contracts can be executed indefinitely without gas being paid."
