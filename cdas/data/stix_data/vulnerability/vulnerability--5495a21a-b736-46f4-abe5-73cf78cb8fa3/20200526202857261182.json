    "description": "The printer friendly version functionality in the Book module in Drupal 6.x before 6.28 and 7.x before 7.19 does not properly restrict access to node that are part of a book outline, which allows remote authenticated users with the \"\"access printer-friendly version\"\" permission to read node titles and possibly node content via unspecified vectors."
