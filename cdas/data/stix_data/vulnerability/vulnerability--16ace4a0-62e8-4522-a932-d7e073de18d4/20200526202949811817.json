    "description": "An issue was discovered in elf_link_input_bfd in elflink.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. There is a NULL pointer dereference in elf_link_input_bfd when used for finding STT_TLS symbols without any TLS section. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld."
