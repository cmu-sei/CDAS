    "description": "The net_get_random_once implementation in net/core/utils.c in the Linux kernel 3.13.x and 3.14.x before 3.14.5 on certain Intel processors does not perform the intended slow-path operation to initialize random seeds, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof or disrupt IP communication by leveraging the predictability of TCP sequence numbers, TCP and UDP port numbers, and IP ID values."
