The <code>Get-MsolRoleMember</code> PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain account names given a role or permissions group.(Citation: Microsoft msolrolemember)(Citation: GitHub Raindance)\n\nAzure CLI (AZ CLI) also provides an interface to obtain user accounts with authenticated access to a domain.
