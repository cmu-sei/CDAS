    "description": "Adversaries may leverage external remote services as a point of initial access into your network. These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services. (Citation: EAttack External Remote Services)\n\nExternal remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system. Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network. In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet. While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability. The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network. Access to valid accounts is often a requirement. \n\nAs they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point\u2010to\u2010point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled. (Citation: Ukraine15 - EISAC - 201603)\n\nIn the Maroochy Attack, the adversary was able to gain remote computer access to the system over radio.\n\nThe 2015 attack on the Ukranian power grid showed the use of existing remote access tools within the environment to access the control system network. The adversary harvested worker credentials, some of them for VPNs the grid workers used to remotely log into the control system networks. (Citation: Ukraine15 - Zetter, Kim) (Citation: Ukraine15 - EISAC - 201603) (Citation: Ukraine15 - ICSCERT) (Citation: Ukraine15 - Fireeye) The VPNs into these networks appear to have lacked two\u2010factor authentication.
