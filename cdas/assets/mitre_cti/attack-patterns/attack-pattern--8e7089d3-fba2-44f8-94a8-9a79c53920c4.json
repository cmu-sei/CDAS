    "description": "Adversaries may brute force I/O addresses on a device and attempt to exhaustively perform an action. By enumerating the full range of I/O addresses, an adversary may manipulate a process function without having to target specific I/O interfaces. More than one process function manipulation and enumeration pass may occur on the targeted I/O range in a brute force attempt.\n\nData Sources: Alarm history, Sequential event recorder, Data historian, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Network protocol analysis, Packet capture",
