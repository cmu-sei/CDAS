    "description": "Adversaries may utilize the camera to capture information about the user, their surroundings, or other physical identifiers. Adversaries may use the physical camera devices on a mobile device to capture images or video. By default, in Android and iOS, an application must request permission to access a camera device which is granted by the user through a request prompt. In Android, applications must hold the `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to access the camera. In iOS, applications must include the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist` file, and must request access to the camera at runtime.",
