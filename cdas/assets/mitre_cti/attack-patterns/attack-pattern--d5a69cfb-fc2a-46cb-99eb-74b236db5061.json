    "description": "Remote System Discovery is the process of identifying the presence of hosts on a network (Citation: EAttack Remote System Discovery), and details about them.  This process is common to network administrators validating the presence of machines and services, as well as adversaries mapping out a network for  future-attack targets. An adversary may attempt to gain information about the target network via network enumeration techniques such as port scanning.  One of the most popular tools for enumeration is [https://nmap.org/ Nmap].  Remote System Discovery allows adversaries to map out hosts on the network as well as the TCP/IP ports that are open, closed, or filtered. Remote System Discovery tools also aid in  by attempting to connect to the service and determine its exact version.  The adversary may use this information to pick an exploit for a particular version if a known vulnerability exists.\n\nData Sources: Process monitoring, Process use of network, Process command-line parameters, Network protocol analysis",
