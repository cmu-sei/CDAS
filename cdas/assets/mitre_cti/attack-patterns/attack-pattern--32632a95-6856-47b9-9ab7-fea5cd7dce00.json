These public-facing applications may include user interfaces, software, data, or commands. In particular, a public-facing application in the IT environment may provide adversaries an interface into the OT environment. \n\nICS-CERT analysis has identified the probable initial infection vector for systems running GE\u2019s Cimplicity HMI with a direct connection to the Internet. \n (Citation: ICS CERT 14-281)\n\nData Sources: Web logs, Web application firewall logs, Application logs, Packet capture",
