    "description": "The mobile device may be targeted for exploitation through its interface to cellular networks or other radio interfaces.\n\n### Baseband Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nA message sent over a radio interface (typically cellular, but potentially Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, Wi-Fi(Citation: ProjectZero-BroadcomWiFi) or other) to the mobile device could exploit a vulnerability in code running on the device(Citation: Register-BaseStation)(Citation: Weinmann-Baseband).\n\n### Malicious SMS Message\n\nAn SMS message could contain content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the SMS parser on the receiving device(Citation: Forbes-iPhoneSMS). An SMS message could also contain a link to a web site containing malicious content designed to exploit the device web browser. Vulnerable SIM cards may be remotely exploited and reprogrammed via SMS messages(Citation: SRLabs-SIMCard).",
