    "description": "Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend in with normal network activity, to avoid more detailed inspection. They may use the protocol associated with the port, or a completely different protocol. They may use commonly open ports, such as the examples provided below.\n* TCP:80 (HTTP)\n* TCP:443 (HTTPS)\n* TCP/UDP:53 (DNS)\n* TCP:1024-4999 (OPC on XP/Win2k3)\n* TCP:49152-65535 (OPC on Vista and later)\n* TCP:23 (TELNET)\n* UDP:161 (SNMP)\n* TCP:502 (MODBUS)\n* TCP:102 (S7comm/ISO-TSAP)\n* TCP:20000 (DNP3)\n* TCP:44818 (Ethernet/IP)\n\nContributors: Matan Dobrushin - Otorio",
