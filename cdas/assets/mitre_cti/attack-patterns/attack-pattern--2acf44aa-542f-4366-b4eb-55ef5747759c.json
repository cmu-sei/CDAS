    "description": "Adversaries may abuse the <code>cron</code> utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The <code>cron</code> utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems.  The <code> crontab</code> file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any <code>crontab</code> files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.\n\nAn adversary may use <code>cron</code> in Linux or Unix environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. <code>cron</code> can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and or to run a process under the context of a specified account.",
