    "description": "If the mobile device is connected (typically via USB) to a charging station or a PC, for example to charge the device's battery, then a compromised or malicious charging station or PC could attempt to exploit the mobile device via the connection(Citation: Krebs-JuiceJacking).\n\nPrevious demonstrations have included:\n\n* Injecting malicious applications into iOS devices(Citation: Lau-Mactans).\n* Exploiting a Nexus 6 or 6P device over USB and gaining the ability to perform actions including intercepting phone calls, intercepting network traffic, and obtaining the device physical location(Citation: IBM-NexusUSB).\n* Exploiting Android devices such as the Google Pixel 2 over USB(Citation: GoogleProjectZero-OATmeal).\n\nProducts from Cellebrite and Grayshift purportedly can use physical access to the data port to unlock the passcode on some iOS devices(Citation: Computerworld-iPhoneCracking).",
