Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.\n\nAdversaries may have prior knowledge through <span class=\"smw-format list-format \"><span class=\"smw-row\"><span class=\"smw-field\"><span class=\"smw-value\">Control Device Identification</span></span></span></span> about security features implemented on control devices.
