    "description": "[NEODYMIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0055) is an activity group that conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims. The group has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called [PROMETHIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0056) due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics. (Citation: Microsoft NEODYMIUM Dec 2016) (Citation: Microsoft SIR Vol 21) [NEODYMIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0055) is reportedly associated closely with [BlackOasis](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0063) operations, but evidence that the group names are aliases has not been identified.
