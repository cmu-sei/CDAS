    "description": "[Patchwork](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040) is a cyberespionage group that was first observed in December 2015. While the group has not been definitively attributed, circumstantial evidence suggests the group may be a pro-Indian or Indian entity. [Patchwork](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040) has been seen targeting industries related to diplomatic and government agencies. Much of the code used by this group was copied and pasted from online forums. [Patchwork](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040) was also seen operating spearphishing campaigns targeting U.S. think tank groups in March and April of 2018.
