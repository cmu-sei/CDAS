Generally this involves mapping the published web site by spidering through all the published links and then attempt to access well-known debugging or logging services, or otherwise predictable services within the site tree. This attack can be especially dangerous since unpublished but available services may not have adequate security controls placed upon them given that an administrator may believe they are unreachable.",
