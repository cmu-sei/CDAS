            "description": "This attack targets the use of the backslash in alternate encoding. An attacker can provide a backslash as a leading character and causes a parser to believe that the next character is special. This is called an escape. By using that trick, the attacker tries to exploit alternate ways to encode the same character which leads to filter problems and opens avenues to attack.",

Another example is \\t, which is sometimes converted into a tab character. There is often an equivalent encoding between the back slash and the escaped back slash. This means that \\/ results in a single forward slash. A single forward slash also results in a single forward slash. The encoding looks like this:</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:div style=\"margin-left:10px;\" class=\"informative\">/ yields /\\/ yields /</xhtml:div>\n            ",

If you believe the target may be filtering the slash, attempt to supply \\/ and see what happens.
