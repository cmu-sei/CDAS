            "description": "Application vetting techniques may be able to alert to the presence of obfuscated or encrypted code in applications, and such applications could have extra scrutiny applied. Unfortunately, this mitigation is likely impractical, as many legitimate applications apply code obfuscation or encryption to resist adversary techniques such as Repackaged Application. Dynamic analysis when used in application vetting may in some cases be able to identify malicious code in obfuscated or encrypted form by detecting the code at execution time (after it is deobfuscated or decrypted). Some application vetting techniques apply reputation analysis of the application developer and can alert to potentially suspicious applications without actual examination of application code.",
