            "description": "On Android devices with a managed work profile (enterprise managed portion of the device), the `DevicePolicyManager.setPermittedCrossProfileNotificationListeners` method can be used to manage the list of applications (including setting it to an empty list) running within the primary user (personal side of the device) that can see notifications occurring within the managed profile. However, this policy only affects notifications generated within the managed profile, not by the rest of the device. The `DevicePolicyManager.setApplicationHidden` method can be used to disable unwanted applications that are accessing notifications, but using this method would block that entire application from running.(Citation: Android Notification Listeners)",
