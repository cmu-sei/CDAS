On Android, apps that target compatibility with Android 7 and higher (API Level 24) default to only trusting CA certificates that are bundled with the operating system, not CA certificates that are added by the user or administrator, hence decreasing their susceptibility to successful man-in-the-middle attack.(Citation: Symantec-iOSProfile2)(Citation: Android-TrustedCA)",
