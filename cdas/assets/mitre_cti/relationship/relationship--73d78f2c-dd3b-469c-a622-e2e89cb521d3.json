            "description": "Enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices to require a minimum complexity (length, etc.) for the device passcode. Enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices to cause the device to wipe all data if an incorrect passcode is entered too many times. Both policies would mitigate brute-force, guessing, or shoulder surfing of the device passcode. If desired, enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices to disallow biometric authentication. However, biometric authentication can help make \"using a longer, more complex passcode far more practical because you don't need to enter it as frequently.\"(Citation: Apple-iOSSecurityGuide)",
