## Configuration

CDAS requires a configuration file at run time, provided by the -c flag on the command line. There are several sample configuration files in the [sample_configs](cdas/sample_configs) folder.

```
$ python -m cdas -c config.json
```

The config file controls whether the data used in the simulator is generated randomly or pulled from default data. It specifies which files to use for data sets and randomization seeding, as well as the settings for the simulation itself. 

The CDAS configuration file has five sections: "agents", "countries", "defenders", "simulation", and "output". 

This section descibes the variables in the configuraiton file.

### Agents Configuration

This section defines the configuration for "agents" or threat actors in the simulation. 

```
    "agents": {
        "randomize_threat_actors": true,
        "random_variables": {
            "actor_name_1": "data/personality_traits.txt",
            "actor_name_2": "data/disney_names.txt",
            "num_agents": 5
        }
    },
```

- randomize_threat_actors
    - True:  generate fake APT profiles
    - False: use APT profiles from the default data set
- random_variables (used if the "randomize_threat_actors" variable is true)
    - actor_name_1 - list of word choices for the first word of the APT actor name
    - actor_name_2 - list of word choices for the second word of the APT actor name
    - num_agents - number of fake APT profiles to generate

### Country Configuration

This section defines the configuration for the geopolitical context component of the simulator.

The coumtries section of the configuration file looks like this:

```
    "countries": {
        "randomize": true,
        "random_vars": {
            "num_countries": 200
        }
    },
```

- randomize
    - True: the simulator generates randomized countries and their associated attributes
    - False: the simulator imports default country data
- random_vars
    - num_countries - the nuber of countries for which the simulator should create fake data; used if the "randomize" variable is true

### Defender Configuration

This section defines the variables for the random creation of defending organizations. There is not a default (non-random) set of defenders available, though users can provide their own set in the input folder to CDAS.

```
"defenders": {
    "number_per_country": 1,
    "org_names": "data/organization_names.txt",
    "sectors": "ANY",
    "countries": "ANY",
    "allow_defense": false
},
```

- number_per_country: number of defending organizations to create per country in the simulation
- org_names: a file containing a list of potential names for defending organizations
- sectors: allows for limiting defenders to certain sectors
    - "ANY" - choose any sector from the default set (provided in [STIX Vocab](cdas/assets/stix_vocab.json))
    - ["sector1", "sector2", "etc"] - a list of sectors (strings)
- countries: allows for limiting defenders to certain countries
    - "ANY" - choose any country from those that have been generated or loaded from the input folder
    - ["country 1", "country 2", "etc"] - a list of country names (strings)
- allow_defense:
    - true: defender makes changes to its network during the simulation
    - false: defender does make changes to its network during the simulation

### Simulation Configuration

This section defines the variables running the simulation and generating events.

```    
"simulation": {
    "number_of_rounds": 5,
    "time_range": [
        "2017-08-01",
        "2020-08-01"
    ]
},
```

- number_of_rounds - Number of times to simulate events. Each threat actor has an opportunity for one action per round. For example, if there are 5 threat actors and 10 rounds, there will be a total of 50 "events" ("sightings" in STIX, and "reports" in PDF).
- time_range - time window over which to space cyber events. Format is is list with start then end date in YYYY-MM-DD format. 

### Output Configuration

This section defines the format, location, and filenames of files generated by CDAS.

```
    "output": {
        "input_directory": "",
        "output_directory": "cdas-output",
        "output_type_opts": ["json", "pdf", "html", "misp"],
        "output_types": ["pdf"],
        "temp_directory": "cdas-temp"
    }
```

- input_directory - Used to provide custom data to CDAS for non-random data. Folders inside input_directory can be 'countries', 'threat-actors', 'malware', 'tools', or 'attack-patterns'. This can also included a "relationships.json" file. If there is no input folder, leave as an empty string (```"input_directory": "",```).
- output_directory - folder to store generated files
- output_type_opts - options available for the "output_types" variable
- output_types - one or more of the available "output_type_opts", separated by commas
    - ex) ```"output_types": ["pdf", "json"],``` would output both PDF and JSON files
- temp_directory - working files directory. Unlikely that this needs to be changed. This folder is deleted after successful completion of the simulation. CDAS will prompt to overwrite an existing folder with this path. 

## Output

CDAS can output results in [PDF](#PDF), [HMTL](#HTML), [JSON](#JSON), or [MISP](#MISP) formats. You can specify one or more types of output for CDAS by changing the "output_types" variable of the configuration file. For instance,

```
"output_types": ["pdf"],
```
will produce PDF output, while 
```
"output_types": ["json", "misp"],
```
will produce both JSON and MISP output (provided in separate folders in the output path).

### PDF

The simplest output that CDAS produces is PDFs, which can be used in various training environments or table-top exercises.  

![PDF output](cdas/assets/images/pdf_output.png)

To produce PDF output, simply change the output_types in the configuration file to "pdf".
```
"output_types": ["pdf"],
```

### HTML

CDAS can produce html files for a website containing the CDAS output. This is probably the cleanest way to include CDAS output in your training environment if you have a webserver available. The webpages do not need any external/third party sources, so they can be dropped into a closed environment.

![HTML output](cdas/assets/images/html_output.png)

To produce html output, simply change the output_types in the configuration file to "html".
```
"output_types": ["html"],
```
This will produce files in a folder called html on your output path. To put this on a web server in your training environment simply copy the entire "html" folder from your output path to your hosted web folder.  

### JSON

CDAS holds its temporary working files in json format. Choosing to output CDAS in json format simply dumps these files to the output path once the simulation is complete. This format is useful to for transferring the output to other tools using homemade conversion scripts, or when you need to ingest CDAS output into another CDAS simulation. For example, if you want to reuse countries or threat actors generated by CDAS in a second round of training exercises, you would chose json as one of your output formats in the first simulation. 

To produce json output, simply change the output_types in the configuration file to "json".
```
"output_types": ["json"],
```
This will produce files in a folder called json on your output path.

It is sometimes helpful to output PDFs at the sametime as json output, since the PDFs are more human readable.
```
"output_types": ["json", "pdf"],
```
This provides both json and PDF output in separate folders on your output path.


### MISP

MISP is an open source threat intelligence platform and open standard for threat information sharing. More information can be found on the MISP home page: [https://www.misp-project.org/](https://www.misp-project.org/). Creating MISP output from CDAS is useful if your training or exercise environment includes a MISP server, or if your toolset includes converters for MISP formatted data.

To produce MISP output, simply change the output_types in the configuration file to "misp".
```
"output_types": ["misp"],
```
This will produce four files in a folder called misp on your output path.

![MISP output folder](cdas/assets/images/misp_output.png)

Transfer these four files to a location where you can access them from your MISP instance. Log on to your MISP instance and import the galaxy clusters first, starting with the country cluster file. 
1. Click on Galaxies --> List Galaxies from the top nav bar
2. Click on Import Galaxy Clusters from the left nav bar

![MISP import](cdas/assets/images/misp_import.png)
3. Click on the Browse button and choose the country-galaxy-cluster.json file
4. Click Submit

You should now see the CDAS generated countries in the Galaxy list in the MISP instance. (Name: Country, Namespace: cdas). Load the other two galaxy clusters the same way. 

Once your galaxy clusters are loaded you can load the events. 
1. Click on Event Actions --> List Events from the top nav bar
2. Click "Import from..." on the left nav bar and choose "MISP standard" as your import format
3. Click the Browse button and choose the events.json file
4. Click Upload

You should now see the CDAS generated events in the Events list in the MISP instance.
